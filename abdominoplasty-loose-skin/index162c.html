</div>you would benefit significantly from a tummy tuck procedure. In order to improve your abdominal region, the abdominoplasty along with a little lipo will help you acheive a flat stomach. A tummy tuck involves repair of the rectus muscles, which was stretched during pregnancy, as well as removal of excess/loose skin.
<p>Make sure that you are finished having children because results can be affected with another pregnancy and tyr to be at your ideal weight before you proceed with surgery to ensure the best results. It is best that you research for a board certified plastic surgeon to perform your surgery for a safe and beautiful result. Recovery can take up to 2-4 weeks so you need to have a good support system during this time. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>There are different bellies after babies. If you have loose skin, you always need to tighten the skin. The only way we have to tighten skin is to cut it out. No exercise, laser, or cream will improve it. When you have a lot of fat as well, you will benefit most from doing liposuction and a abdominoplasty .
<p>You cannot liposuction the front and abdominoplasty it at the same time. You can liposuction the rest of you- your back and love handles / flank and then tummy tuck the front. I prefer this approach, as you contour the entire torso in one shot, so you look proportioned and natural. If you just tuck the front, then your belly is really flat and your back and love handles have rolls of fat- it doesn’t look good.</p><p></p>

</div>Also, when I remove the fat from the backside, your skin will loosen, some of which I can tighten when I flip you and do the tummy tuck on the other side. So for you, exercise is good, but you can’t fix this on your own. Lose as much weight as you can, get into good shape, and then see a surgeon. (Lauren Greenberg, MD, Palo Alto Plastic Surgeon)
<p>you have signficiant excess skin and fat of the abdominal wall, as well as laxity (looseness) of the abdominal wall muscles. The operation that will provide you the best result is a abdominoplasty . Through an incision at the bikini line, the excess skin and fat of your abdominal wall can be removed.</p><p>The same incision will allow tightening of your abdominal wall muscles to eliminate your upper and lower abdominal bulges. It is also very common to add liposuction to the procedure to contour the hips. Your results will be improved if you can lose some weight prior to the procedure. </p><p></p>

</div>Although it’s not easy, losing weight will diminish the risk of complications and improve the final cosmetic result.(Sam Jejurikar, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)
<p><em>Tummy Tuck to remove excess skin</em><br>
You have a significant amount of excess skin on your stomach that is creating double folds. </p><p>If you imagine trading the shadows from the two skin creases for one scar with a smooth abdominal contour, that would be the general result from an abdominoplasty. The skin between the fold from your belly button to the fold from your c-section would be removed. </p><p></p>

</div>Ideally you would want to perform the procedure when you are within 10% of your goal / ideal body weight, but if you have been stable in your weight and feel that it is unlikely to change, it is reasonable to proceed at this time.
<p>Because of your “pannus” of skin, a abdominoplasty will result in a significant change for you. The part of the procedure that is limited by your weight is the abdominal wall tightening component – it could be tightened more (which results in a flatter abdomen) if your weight was closer to ideal. If you loose weight after the procedure, you will “deflate” and loose some of the result. I would suggest you visit with a board certified plastic surgeon to discuss your goals and issues related to weight changes. (Michael A. Bogdan, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Tummy Contouring After Pregnancy</strong><br>
Tummy tuck (also called abdominoplasty) is a very popular cosmetic surgery procedure for moms in Houston. A tummy tuck can be an effective tool for shaping and sculpting the body for better body appearance and improved self esteem. </p><p></p>

</div>Sometimes no amount of diet and exercise can create a flat tummy. This procedure actually tightens abdominal muscles and removes excess fat and skin from the stomach area to create a tighter, slimmer, smoother belly.
<p>Abdominoplasty can be combined with other procedures such as liposuction or breast implants for a sexier look. Patients choose abdominoplasty cosmetic surgery for a number of reasons, including:</p><ul>
<li>Excess abdominal skin following weight loss</li>
<li>Weight gain (beer belly or spare tire) from a sedentary lifestyle Abdominal fat that is resistant to diet and exercise</li>
<li>Stretched stomach muscles from pregnancy</li>
<li>Desire for a thinner profile</li>
<li>Desire to look younger and fitter</li>
<li>Desire to fit into clothes better</li>
</ul><p></p>

</div>I recommend you visit with a board certified ASPS member surgeon to review your options and to find out if you are a good candidate for the procedure. (C. Bob Basu, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)
<p>You would benefit greatly from a tummy tuck and see a dramatic improvement. Your condition is very commonly seen after pregnancy, so don’t be worried. With a tummy tuck, the loose skin will be removed, the excess fat is removed, and the loose muscles are tightened – all resulting in a nice flat and firm tummy! (Randy J. Buckspan, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If your weight is stable I would say look at an extended tummy tuck or lower body lift. Also make sure you are completed with childbearing first. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Full abdominoplasty after weight loss</b><br>
To improve the appearance of your abdomen, I would first suggest trying to lose weight. You will most definitely need a full tummy tuck but the results are often better when the excess weight is off first. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Pregnancy, apple body, and tummy tucks</h5><p>From the photos you have a classic “apple body” which is a genetically programmed shape, and pregancy makes it manifest itself more. Everything is concentrated around the middle. A abdominoplasty with lipo on the hips and back is the best approach to this. Often patients I see with this body type are exercise fanatics but their legs just keep getting skinnier while the middle is relatively unaffected. One other bit of advice is that the upper inner thigh area seems to be part of the apple body favorite areas for a little extra fat. So if you only do the tummy, hips and back it may all want to go there. (Richard Baxter, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Body contouring through liposuction and tummy-tuck</h3><p></p>

</div>Pregnancy and child birth extract a great toll on a woman’s body. Mother’s day is a National Holiday for a reason and we should all thank our mothers for their sacrifices. Pregnancy results in loose skin, stretch marks, separation of the abdominal muscles (diastasis) and fatty accumulation of the abdomen and love handles. After reviewing your photos, I would recommend a tummy-tuck combined with liposuction of the abdomen, waist and flanks.
<p>This procedure has consistently produced one of the highest patient satisfaction rates in my practice. You will not only look and feel better, but your clothing will fit better by flattening your abdomen and lowering your waistline. As with all body contouring procedures, the results of your tummy-tuck and liposuction are best maintained through healthy life-style changes, including diet and exercise. (Andrew T. Lyos, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Correcting loose abdomen after pregnancy</em><br>
Abdominoplasty, or tummy tuck, is a procedure that is designed to correct the loose muscles and remove the loose skin of the abdomen due to pregnancy. The procedure may be combined with liposuction in order to achieve the best aesthetic result. (Olivia Hutchinson, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Plastic surgery after pregnancy</h4><p>Many women feel the same way you do. After carrying and birthing children, a woman’s body is never the same as it was before the pregnancy. It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and continue to exercise and eat right. Your health can be crucial in the possibility of having surgery. Healthy people have fewer complications and an overall shorter recover period. In your case, I would recommend consulting with a plastic surgeon about the possibility of an extended abdominoplasty . A standard abdominoplasty has an incision from hip to hip where an extended tummy tuck may go past the hips and potentially all the way around the waist. (Joseph G. Bauer, MD, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Post pregnancy tummy</strong><br>
There are thousands of woman with the same problem that you have. The treatment for this would be a Tummy Tuck and possible Liposuction. You will require help at home and at least a 2 week recovery time. I believe you will be so happy with this surgery you will wonder why no one told you about it before. (Linda Swanson, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>You can have a very big improvement with a tummy tuck which can make the surface of your abdomen smooth by getting rid of the folds. However you do have some weight to lose based on the roundness of your upper abdomen and your results will be better if you lose that first. That’s not possible for everyone so see a well trained and board certified plastic surgeon in your area and get his advice also. Whichever path you choose, you’re going to be very happily surptised. (Ronald V. DeMars, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>Solution to current abdominal appearence</strong><br>
You will get a variety of answers based on the plastic surgeons preference. Additional weight loss would be ideal. In terms of plastic surgery solutions my preference based on your photos is abdominoplasty and circumferential trunk liposuction. There is some disagreement among plastic surgeons about the safety of doing so in combination with an abdominoplasty. If done properly the combination could provide a dramatic result. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Abdominoplasty and/or liposuction</strong><br>
Abdominoplasty can remove excess fat and skin that is resistant to diet and exercise. Liposuction can be used with abdominoplasty to improve the shape of your waist. (Sanjiv Kayastha, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
