<p>Here you will find reviews about Dr Richard J Bruneteau from Yelp, Google Plus, Realself.com, Realpatientratings.com and others.</p><p>-I am writing this review 1 year post procedure so that I could offer a review on what to expect from full recovery (which is a long process). I had the Mommy Makeover done in June 2017 and added additional liposuction procedures of the upper arms and the chin area to better define my jawline and reduce appearance of a double chin. I also added breast augmentation to make me more proportionate as despite my weight gain I had always had a smaller chest. An important note about the Mommy Makeover is that the tummy tuck does not include lipo of the upper abdomen. So while you will see significant improvement to the tightening of the lower abdomen and reduction in size of the hips and thighs, additional lipo may be suggested post recovery. This area is also more easily impacted by diet and excercise and if you are truly committed to your investment in the Mommy Makeover, lifestyle changes should be part of your goal to maintain results. My starting size going into the procedure was a womenâs size 14, 38 Large B to Small C chest size and I was weighing in at about 184 lbs. For reference on how this measures on a BMI scale I am 5â² 8â³ tall.The procedure induced some of the worst post op pain Iâve experienced. I felt like I had been beat up. I could barely walk and moving from standing to sitting was also incredibly painful. Fortunately, the worst of the pain exponentially decreased day by day and was managed to tolerable levels by the post op meds. The 1st week was most difficult from a pain perspective. Anyone considering the procedure should probably plan on being homebound for at least 1 week. It is advisable to have someone who can be with you periodically throughout the day for that 1st week to help with daily activities. Bathing also wonât happen for most of the 1st week due to incisions. Trust me, noone will want to see you that 1st week ð The 2nd week was significantly better. However, due to compression garments and incision drain tubes, it still wasnât practical to be doing much out of the house. I was up and around and doing more of my daily activities but at a slower pace and still with some discomfort. I have a job where I can work from home and took advantage of that option for my 2nd week of recovery. By the 3rd week, I was able to complete most of my daily activities with minimal discomfort or need for assistance and at that time returned to work.As far as results, even with the significant swelling post surgery, I could see immediate results. by 6 weeks post surgery the swelling was greatly reduced and results were noticeable enough that I was already needing smaller sized clothes. 3 months post surgery was when I felt the majority of the swelling was gone and 6 months post surgery was when it appeared nearly all of it was gone. By 6 months out I was maintaining at about 10 lbs lost and 4 inches on the waist line (going from a size 14 to size 10 / 34 inch to 30 inch pant waist). I did experience some numbness in the abdomen and the nipples where even a year out, full sensation has not returned. I have not found this to be a detractor in comparison to how much better everything looks. It was something that was positioned during consult a risk of the surgery so I was prepared for this being part of the experience and this is not cause for me to regret making the decision. I also have scarring on the bikini line and under the breasts that are still quite visible a year out. They will continue to lighten but I donât think they will likely ever lighten to the point where they arenât noticeable at all. The good thing is that these will always be covered by traditional undergarments so even in a swimsuit the scarring should not be noticeable.I am extremely satisfied with my results. I would definitely recommend Bruneteau and his partners to help anyone achieve similar results.Â <strong>(Jocelyn Taylor)</strong></p><p>-Teri ThomasÂ âââââ<br>
So very happy with my procedure and my experiences I had in getting my âMommy Makeoverâ. Dr Bruneteau and his staff were always there when needed, and answered any questions I had going into the surgery. I am now two months post-op and I feel wonderful! I still have a couple of months to go before I really see the results of the surgery, but so far I am so very happy with the way I look and feel.</p><p>â<strong>Kara TyeÂ </strong>âââââ<br>
I recently had a Breast Augmentation done by Dr. Richard Bruneteau at Surgical Images. I had an amazing experience there! My Dr. & staff were so friendly, & knowledgeable. They made me feel comfortable 100% of the time. My results turned out better than I could have even imagined! I am extremely pleased! 10/10 would recommend!</p><p>â<strong>kaitlin kellyÂ </strong>âââââ<br>
I highly recommend Dr. Bruneteau and the staff at aesthetic surgical images (ASI). They more than exceeded my expectations from initial consultation to post surgery my entire life has changed for the better following my procedure. My only regret is that I didnât act sooner. If youâre even thinking about improving your image call ASI today the procedure is simple and the cost is more affordable than you can imagine!! Thanks ASI youâve changed my life and image to what Iâve dreamed of for years !!</p><p>â<strong>Heather Belanger DollÂ </strong>âââââ<br>
From the moment I left my free consultation, I knew I had made the right decision to have my breast augmentation done at Aesthetic Surgical Images. All of the staff were welcoming and knowledgable. All of my questions were answered with ease. My mother had a breast augmentation done here about 12 years ago and she is very pleased as well. I am almost 4 weeks out from surgery currently, and I am healing nicely. I am a pretty conservative dresser and I did not want this surgery to be noticed, thatâs not why I did it. I had this done for myself. My only consideration would have been going a little bigger ð If you are considering this surgery, it is definitely much easier than I had thought. I had it done on a Friday morning and was back at work on Monday, only missing one day of work. I would definitely recommend Dr. Bruneteau!</p><p>-I went to ASI because one of my 11 year old breast implants ruptured. Dr. Bruneteau told me that it was impossible to remove and replace my implants through my existing scar on my nipple. I was very vocal about how disappointing that was, I recently battled cancer (lymphoma) and I have more than enough scars on my body already.He was absolutely certain, it was not an option to go through the nipple. He said he never puts implants in through the nipple because he canât take them out that way. He said he was surprised that my original doctor (who is in a different state) hadnât told me this would be an issue if one of my implants ruptured. I was very disappointed but I trusted him.A few days before my fully paid for procedure, his nurse called asking for an additional $900. Once again, they blamed the issue on my previous surgeon. He under filled an implant by less than a tea spoon, thus voiding the lifetime replacement guarantee from the manufacturer. I told the nurse I couldnât afford that. I wrote her an email requesting a full accounting of everything Iâve paid for up to that point. Instead of giving me an itemized invoice, she calls me back saying the doctor is so gracious, heâs not going to charge me the extra $900. Then she said Dr. Bruneteau ordered my implants a size smaller than what was agreed on. When I objected to the smaller implants she backtracked and said they were the right size.I went from being mildly worried about the surgery to absolutely terrified that I was making a huge mistake! I especially didnât like their pompous attitude towards my original surgeon. He is highly regarded and well respected in South Florida, where surgeons are a dime a dozen, his reviews are excellent and he has his own morning talk show. Dr. Bruneteau on the other hand, has a lot of bad reviews out there. The more I read the scarier he seemed. So I canceled the surgery and got my money back.The surgeon I ultimately chose must be a miracle worker because he did the impossible, and used my original scar to remove and replace my implants!I am absolutely appalled that Dr. Bruneteau flat out lied to me about my incision options! He might not have the skills to give me what I wanted, but he should have been honest with me and said that heâs not personally comfortable going in through my nipple, instead of declaring it impossible! Granted, had he been up front about his capabilities compared to other local surgeons I wouldnât go with him. Why learn new methods when you can just lie to your patients instead?I wouldnât recommend ASI to anyone, unless youâre looking for outdated surgical methods, uncaring, and unimaginative doctors who see you only as a money making vessel rather than an individual human being.<strong> (C K)</strong></p><p>-I had been dissatisfied with my nose for my entire life. I was rejected by two previous plastic surgeons who did not have the courage to help me. I went to Dr. BRUNETEAU, borderline about to give up my dream of a better nose. He assured me that it could be done, he could help me. He did just that, he changed my life. He just blew the other surgeons out of the water! He educated me on everything, & he got my trust, turning my life long dream, into a reality. He did such a great job on my nose, he is truly a great man & if you must get plastic surgery once in your life, I urge you to go to Dr. BRUNETEAU. <strong>(Austin Cook)</strong></p><p>-I finally made the decision to have a brow lift after drooping and heaviness in the brow area continued to worsen over time, leaving me to feel I at times looked tired & cranky when I was not. Iâve known Dr. Bruneteau for many years and without an ounce of hesitation, put 100% confidence in him to perform this surgery for me, knowing it would turn out great. He listens, is genuinely caring, conscientious and understanding to a patientâs questions and concerns from the initial consultation through the entire recovery process. I highly recommend him to anyone considering cosmetic surgery â you will be in very good hands. The well experienced surgical staff at Surgical Images was also very warm, caring and professional, making the surgery experience a smooth and positive one for me. I am very happy with the result!<strong> (Diane Braun)</strong></p><p>-I recently had a tummy tuck and liposuction done by Dr. Bruneteau. He is absolutely amazing, reassuring and talented. He did two consultations prior to my surgery and requires several follow ups after surgery which impressed me because it shows he cares about my results. Heâs so kind and listened to what I wanted. I cannot believe how nice he is and really delivers incredible results. Iâm only three days post surgery and even with swelling I can see a dramatic difference. I cannot wait to see the final results. I would recommend Dr. Bruneteau over any plastic surgeon. Also, the staff and nurses were wonderful and caring. Heâs a board certified plastic surgeon which is gold standardâ¦.be careful of the label âcosmetic surgeonâ because any doctor can call themselves a âcosmetic surgeonâ but not a plastic surgeon. Highly recommend Dr. Bruneteau and his staff!<strong> (Lynette M.)</strong></p><p>-I have been a patient of Dr Bruneteauâs since I was 12 years old. He was one of the many wonderful surgeons I had to operate on my cleft lip and palate. He is a caring, personable, and wonderful doctor. 25 years later and after 2 kids, I decided to go back and see him at Surgical Images for a mommy makeover with a breast reduction. I am so incredibly happy with the results! He is one of the best surgeons in the area! All of his staff is wonderful as well! They make you feel comfortable from the very beginning! Thank you again Dr Breneteau and your wonderful staff!!! <strong>(Becky)</strong></p><p>-I went to Dr Bruneteau to get a breast reduction. During the course of our conversation he started asking me questions about my back and if I have had a lot of pain. Long story short my abdomen wall had detached from my body so for over 20 years I had lived with pain and mental suffering. He explained everything in detail and was very caring. I did both surgeries at once. He and his staff were wonderful. They helped me through my nervousness and made me feel more confident about what I was doing. This was not a decision I made lightly and they were there with me through it all. Not one of the staff every made me feel like I was just a number or a money bucket. I have been very pleased with the results. My back no longer has pain and the reduction was the best thing I could have every done. I would and do highly recommend Dr. Bruneteau and his staff for any cosmetic surgery that you might think you want to do. <strong>(wendy buchanan)</strong></p><p>-Iâm 3 months post op from my breast augmentation and tummy tuck. Iâm way beyond satisfied with my results. Dr. Richard Bruneteau is not only an amazing surgeon, very knowledgeable and takes his time to get know you. Iâve never felt as comfortable with a Dr. as I have been with him. He surpassed my expectations and can only imagine how great the end result will be. With Aesthetic Surgical Images you cannot go wrong! <strong>(Jen Benedix)</strong></p><p>-Michelle P âââââ<br>
After breastfeeding 2 kids, I was not happy with my breast size. I scheduled my consultation with Dr. Bruneteau (who came HIGHLY recommended by a family member who had a tummy tuck with him). I immediately felt comfortable with Dr. Bruneteau and everyone was very polite and welcoming. The day of my surgery I was very nervous and my nurse put me at ease. The anesthesiologist came in and was awesome. Next thing I know, I was waking up in post-op! The first 9 days of recovery were a bit tough, but I am VERY happy with my results and would encourage anyone else who is not happy with their current breast size to look into an augmentation. Each time Iâve gone back for check ups, I always feel welcomed and I never feel like just a number to the staff at Aesthetic Surgical Images. This is something I have wanted for the past 7-10 years and now thanks to Dr. Bruneteau and Aesthetic Surgical Images, I am FINALLY comfortable in my own skin and feel great about the way I look.</p><p>-Renee SalemÂ âââââ 5 years ago<br>
I had a great experience at Aethetic Surgical Images. Dr. Brunuteau was very professional and kind. I would highly recommend them and would do it all over again! Worth every penny!</p><p>-jcr âââââ 5 years ago<br>
I canât rave enough about the staff and Dr. Bruneteau. I had a breast reduction four months ago and am beyond satisfied with the results. Not only is Dr Bruneteau a master at his craft, his bed side manner is beyond professional. I was so nervous about the procedure and Dr. Bruneteau along with his staff, was right beside me calming me and answering any questions I had. I would highly recommend him to anyone even considering this procedure! In fact, I went to him because a friend of mine had the same procedure a year before with the same amazing results. A+++ rating in my book!</p><p>-cheri melichar ââ 4 years ago<br>
DO NOT GO HERE! This was the worst experience I have EVER had with a medical facility. Where do I start? I had a lot of issues with infection and it was painful. Dr Bruenetau basically came in the exam room, manhandled my sore infected breast and told the PA what to do with it and left the room. I am disfigured from it worse than the partial mastectomy I had in 2005 because I feel they did not take the necessary precautions, the doctor, the medical staff and the reception staff to prevent all the trouble I had. They are uncaring and just move people through like cattle.</p><p>-Christy Sotoropolis âââââ 4 years ago<br>
From the moment my husband and I walked into Aesthetic Surgical Images we knew we found the right office. We were greeted with professionalism and friendliness. During my consultation we were very well informed about the procedures I was wanting to have done. Dr. Bruneteau was very caring and answered all of our questions and concerns very thoroughly. He didnât seemed rushed and took all the time we needed with him. The staff was very knowledgeable, professional, and caring. Overall we had a wonderful experience so we decided to go ahead and schedule that day. We were very pleased with the cost of my facelift, breast lift, and eyebrow surgery. We were also given a military discount. When going in for my surgery I was extremely nervous but the nurses were so caring and calming. The anesthesiologist greeted me and gave me details of what he was going to be doing. The surgery went very smoothly and while in post op I was taken very well care of. During my recovery I have been being seen by the office multiple times for suture removal, check ups, etc. With each visit I am even more pleased. They really make you feel like youâre the most important person there. They are very gentle with the suture removal as well! Also, Dr. Bruteneau still always takes his time during my appointments answering any questions that I had. With the surgery itself, I couldnât be more ecstatic! My body looks amazing and I find myself wanting to look into the mirror more and I used to hate looking into the mirror. I couldnât thank Dr. Bruneteau and his staff more for what they have done for my. My husband is Air Force so we move every 3 years but if I ever want or need another cosmetic surgery I will definitely fly back to Omaha to be treated at Aesthetic Surgical Images and would recommend their office to anyone!</p><p>-Kim Cooper âââââ 4 years ago<br>
I am 59 years old and felt I was probably too old to have a breast lift that I had been considering for many years. With the encouragement of my daughter I found Aesthetic Surgical Images in Omaha. From the moment my husband and I met Dr. Bruneteau, we knew we had chosen the right clinic and dr. Dr. Bruneteau assured me that I wasnât too old and made me feel very comfortable with what I had chosen to have done. I had a Mommy Makeover, which included breast lift, tummy tuck and liposuction of the hips and buttocks. Iâll be very honestâthere were rough moments. The first week was pretty difficult. I really did need my husbandâs help for almost everything. We live 4 hours from Omaha, so we had alot of travel back and forth. I have difficulty with pain medication, so I only took those for about 3 days. The liposuction was the most painful in the beginning, however that heals fairly quickly. Probably the hardest part for me was sleeping on my back, since I am a stomach sleeper! The drains from the tummy tuck were a nuisance, but were gone by the end of the 2nd week and I felt so much better when they were both removed! Thatâs the consânow the POSITIVE! My surgery was 5 weeks ago and I canât believe the results! The breast lift was easy! Very little pain there and I am so pleased with the results! I still have a few scabs that are still healing. My tummy is so flat and my shape has definitely improved! Iâm still in the beginning stages of healing, but I am so glad I had the surgery. It was definitely worth it!!! Thank you ASI!!!</p><p>-Lexi L âââââ 4 years ago<br>
Overall the experience prior and during surgery was as I expected. It felt as if my doctor had done several of the same procedures and it did feel a bit like an assembly line. But Dr. Brunateau and the nurses were all very helpful and accomodating throughout the process. I feel like Dr. Brunateau did a good job of going over what complications could occur but I would have liked a more âpersonalâ touch to this â what was more likely in my own case. I really did not have a discussion on options either aside from saline vs. silicone. Unfortunately after surgery, I did not see Dr. Brunateau again until my 7 week postop visit (saw either a PA or another Dr). Now about three months postop, I am noticing several problems that need to be discussed with my surgeon. I hope I get to visit with Dr. Brunateau and will get good information on what to expect and measures that need to be taken.</p><p>-Mary Fleer âââââ 4 years ago<br>
I decided this past spring to have lipo of my neck/chin in California (being the plastic surgery capitol and all). Well they left some blobby bits in so instead of having it redone in California, I elected to go to Dr. Bruneteau (who I had seen for a consultation before and was very impressed with) for a repeat procedure. Wow! Where to begin! The 2 experiences were very, very different. Dr. Bruneteau and staff were amazing â¦ from only taking 1 stick to get my IV (vs 14 tries the other procedure) to having me in surgical garb, to full sedation, to a relaxing atmosphere both pre- and postop, to the quality of follow up care (including the fact that Dr. B comes to Norfolk) â¦ totally different experience. The care I received at Aesthetic Surgical Images was fabulous â¦ I felt comfortable from the minute I walked into the clinic, through the entire experience, postop and even now in the follow-up phase. I would highly recommend them to anyone. I assumed that California would be the place to go for facial procedures but I was wrong â¦ we have a great place here in Nebraska! Wouldnât hesitate to use them again if I decide to have other procedures in the future! Thanks ASI!!!</p></div></div></article>
