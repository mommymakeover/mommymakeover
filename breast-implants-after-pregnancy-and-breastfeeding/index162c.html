When all of these coincide, that will be the best time for you to have breast implants and tummy tuck . (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The best advice on timing is first make sure that you aren’t planning to have more babies, then you want to lose any weight gain associated with pregnancy. You should be off breastfeeding for at least 3 months. A very important consideration is having help during your recovery. You need to avoid lifting for several weeks and be a little bit selfish about making sure your own needs are being met. (Richard Baxter, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>When timing a breast implants and tummy tuck, there are two primary issues. Making sure your body has completely recovered from pregnancy and childbirth, and making sure you have the support system necessary to recover from these procedures in place.</p><p>8 months after delivery, your body should be stable and ready. With regard to your children and their care, you understand their needs better than anyone, but I would agree with my colleagues that it’s probably not going to get easier for you until your youngest is ~5 or 6 years old, and your 8 month old is probably a lot easier to care for than he/she will be between ages 18 months (mobility!) and 5 years. Now may be a good time.

</div><p>There is never one best time, for a breast implants and tummy tuck you want to be done having kids and have stopped nursing by at least 6 months and be at your best weight. The age of the kids is your problem – get a Nannie for a few days or put your husband or parents to work.</p><p>Or sometimes the best thing is to move into a friends house ( without children) for a few days. If you are young and healthy, recovery is rapid. (William B. Rosenblatt, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Each component of what you describe as a breast implants and tummy tuck has variations that may affect recovery time. The most important things are that you are in a healthy, stable lifestyle so you are as fit as you can be and your activity and weight are stable.</p><p>Presumably, you have stopped breast feeding and your breasts are stable in size and shape. Of course you will need to set aside some recovery time and three kids demand a lot of your time and energy so you will need to plan for help.</p><p>Recovery can last up to three weeks before you might feel comfortable running after your young children, driving them to activities, and having the energy to deal with all their daily concerns. Finally, you should do the surgery when you feel it would benefit you.</p><p>If you are ready to go and enthusiastic, then there is no real reason to wait. One could say “wait until all the children are out of the house and you have time for yourself” but that of course defeats the purpose of maximizing your positive feelings about yourself at the time it will benefit you. (Robin T.W. Yuan, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I hate the term “mommy makeover” because it implies a specific procedure when, in fact, each woman may need something different. For the breasts, some women will need breast augmentation or augmentation with a breast lift or even a breast reeuction depending on the individual circumstances. For the abdomen, contouring can be accomplished with liposuction or a tummy tuck or a combination of both.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_885" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-616770de351ecbe132babf5831dfd60f">

</div><p>In general, the most important thing is that you know that you are finished having children.</p><p>I also ask that patients have stopped breast feeding for at least 3 months prior to surgery. Breast and abdominal contouring can be done any time after that.</p><p>The best results are obtained when you are at or near your desired weight so weight loss BEFORE doing these procedures is recommended, if you feel the need.</p><p>I advise my patients to have some additional help with the kids for about 2 weeks after which they should feel comfortable enough to resume normal, daily non-strenuous activities including driving.</p><p>Strenuous activities such a exercise is limited for a total of 6 weeks after surgery. The final results can be expected 2-3 months after the procedure. (Scott Greenberg, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Now is a good time for Mommy Makeover consultations</em><br>
If you’ve recovered from your last pregnancy and are close to your ‘goal’ weight, and body weight has been stable for a few months — its time to start meeting plastic surgeons and reviewing your surgical options.</p><p>One consideration to keep in mind is the care of your three young children after your ‘makeover’ surgery. You will have weight lifting restrictions, surgical drains to look after, and will likely be recovering at home for close to 10 days before resuming a normal activity schedule. Hopefully you have some family or friends locally that can help out during the recovery period. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>During the post operative period your lifting and activity will be restricted to avoid complications. If you can arrange to have assistance during this period, I would proceed at any time as long as you have attained a stable weight. If , however, you don’t have much help, waiting for your 8 month old to be capable of walking without being lifted may be a better idea. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Breast implants and tummy tuck after children</h5><p>It’s best to make sure that you have enough help for at least 2 weeks, and preferably closer to six weeks, prior to having surgery. Heavy lifting really needs to be limited for 6 weeks after having a tummy tuck.</p><p>If you have help for only two weeks, I would suggest doing just the breasts, and then waiting until the baby does not need to be lifted as much prior to doing the abdomen. Good luck. (Nina S. Naidu, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>When to get a breast implants and tummy tuck</strong></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_886" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The proper timing of getting a breast implants and tummy tuck, including tummy tuck, breast augmentation, and liposuction, is largely related to how quickly your body recovers after your last pregnancy. For most women, it’s best to wait at least 6 months.</p><p>Your plastic surgeon can help you make this decision at your consultation. You also have to realize that you would not be able to do heavy lifting for about 3-4 weeks after the tummy tuck. (Arnold S. Breitbart, MD, FACS, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>while we recommend that patients don’t lift heavy things post-op, realistically most have small children and we know that they lift them.</p><p>Crib lifting is the main thing to avoid and it is important to be as careful as you can and listen to your body closely. 8 month olds are easier to manage than feisty 2 year olds so you might want to go ahead now. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Do tummy tuck and breast implants one year after last pregnancy.</i></p><p>Sounds like you could do it soon. If you are still breast feeding, then wait at least six months after you stop breast feeding to do mommy makeover (tummy tuck, breast implants, etc.). Also, make sure your post-pregnancy weight has stabilized. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The best time to get your surgeries is when you decide is appropriate for your own situation and when you can have the time for yourself to recover from surgery. Only you can decide that. We can tell you if you are a candidate for this or other surgery. (Samir Shureih, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Timing a “Mommy Makeover” after last pregnancy</h4><p>Opinions will vary on this subject. I feel that waiting one year after delivery of your last child would allow your body to fully recover from the many effects of pregnancy.</p><p>You would also want to try to be at your best/optimal weight before this type of surgery (to get the best results), however long that might take. (Robert C. Bledsoe, Jr., MD, Grapevine Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
