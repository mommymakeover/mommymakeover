Costs include surgeon, anaesthetic, and facility fees.</p><p>Ask to see if followups are included and any garments that are needed. I would strongly suggest that you choose the surgeon not so much on the price but based on the trust you have that they will give you an amazing result, the rapport you build with them, and the confidence that they will be just as happy to see and support you after surgery as they are before. (Rodger Shortt, FRCSC, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>When a breast lift and a abdominoplasty are combined together we typically refer to this is as a Mommy make over.</p><p>The term Mommy make over refers to a surgical procedure in which both the breast and the abdomen are operated on to correct changes that happened as a result of being a mom.</p><p>In essence correcting changes from the collarbone down through the knees. To correct the changes in the breast to give them a more aesthetic appearance, surgeries would be designed to lift and/or enlarge.</p><p>The breast procedures could include; a breast reduction, breast augmentation, ,a breast lift , or a breast lift with implants. The surgeries to improve the abdominal contour could include liposuction alone, a abdominoplasty with or without liposuction, a lipo-abdominoplasty, or a mini-tummy.</p><p>The ultimate cost of a Mommy make over will vary depending on which of these surgical procedures are combined together. The total cost not only is dependent on which procedures you choose, but will include charges for the facility, anesthesia and the surgeon’s fee.</p><p></p>

</div>Miscellaneous fee could also include implants, medications, pre-op labs, dressings and post op garments. The cost for implants will vary a little bit from Doctor to Doctor. (John Mancoll, MD, Virginia Beach Plastic Surgeon)
<p>the prince range may vary depending of the surgeon and the location you choose. For example, here in the Dominican Republic, prices may go from 4500-7000.</p><p>Usd depending if you get the lift with an implant or not. Hope my answered helped you. (Luis Tactuk Simo, MD, Dominican Republic Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Prices can vary significantly with your geographic location, and also with the degree of complexity of your operation.</p><p>That said, in the NYC area where I practice, most reputable board certified plastic surgeons charge between $12k and $20k for a combined abdominoplasty and breast lift. (Joshua D. Zuckerman, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>Costs for a abdominoplasty and breast lift will certainly vary depending on your location. Things to factor in for the abdominoplasty / breast standpoint will be the facility fee, anesthesia fee, surgeon fee, other fees (e.g., liposuction, surgical garment, etc.)
<p>A range in price ~$10000-18000 is not unreasonable. $12-14K would be a reasonable cost on average. A consultation with a plastic surgeon will help you in determining which procedure(s) would be the right one for you.</p><p>Cost also depends on the complexity of your case and how much work would need to be done to achieve an aesthetically-pleasing tummy for you. (Lewis Albert Andres, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You are describing what is often called a mommy makeover. Some women elect to have post baby body concerns addressed in a single surgery, Others prefer to stage surgeries for various reasons. In many women, it reasonable to perform both breast lift and a abdominoplasty in a single surgery.</p><p></p>

</div>Pricing for this surgery will vary significantly, based on the extent of a abdominoplasty, and also based on the training and expertise of a plastic surgeon. The most expensive plastic surgeon may not always be the best, but the lowest priced surgeon will almost certainly be cutting corners that could impact your safety and / or results.
<p>Look for lots of before and after photos ofabdominoplasties, breasts lifts and mommy makeovers. Be sure that the tummy ticks didn’t leave women with unnatural looking belly buttons or scars around the belly button.</p><p>Check the credentials of your plastic surgeon including membership of ASPS and ASAPS. Check for surgical suite accreditation and ask who will be in the OR with you when you have your surgery. If you like the many photos you see, you feel like your surgeon has received excellent training and you like the surgeons philosophy, schedule a consultation.</p><p></p>

</div>You need to feel like your surgeon listens to you and understands your goals. You need to feel a connection with staff members and you should never feel pressured into scheduling surgery. Prior to scheduling surgery, you should be able to speak to previous patients who have had the same surgery.
<p>The most expensive surgery is one that leaves you with poor result. akin your time searching a plastic surgeon who will be making a permanent change to your body. (Michael Law, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>These fees will vary by location. In new york my range for these two procedures will run from $12,000-$18,500. (Norman Bakshandeh, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is difficult to give an average cost of these procedures combined. Pricing differs from location to surgeon. Here in Tampa pricing ranges between $10,000 – 13000. Be sure you consult with a board certified plastic surgeon who is experienced in both procedures.

<p>Plastic surgery vary depending on the geographic location and the expertise of the surgeon. The combination of breast lift and abdominoplasty vary depending on the complexity of the case. No two individuals are the same. The range is generally from $6000 to $20000. (Kris M.

</div>Well known proficient plastic surgeons charge more. There is no standard. (William B. Rosenblatt, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)
<p>The fees for a breast lift and abdominoplasty will vary aroudn the country and of course only estimates can be given based upon the minimum procedure that may be offered( lift without implants).</p><p>IN NYC the surgeon’s fee for both may run between $12,000-$25,000. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A breast lift and a full tummy tuck would be about $16,000. If you are looking to have implants placed at the same time as the lift, it would be about $18,000 or so.</p><p>However, these prices vary considerably based on the city you’re in and the surgeon you choose to have perform your surgery.

</div>In my practice the cost of a tummy tuck and breast lift combined may range from $15,000 to $22,000, depending on the size of the patient and complexity of the procedures.
<p>Patient needs are highly variable. (David Stoker, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Average cost for a breast lift and tummy tuck combined In USA range of fees are from $9000 to $15,000. You need to see 3 boarded PS in your area to discuss this IN DETAIL! (Darryl J.

</div>I always suggest visiting a few different surgeons to get an idea of price range in your area, but remember that a focus on safety and surgical skill should take priority over finances. (Frank Campanile, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Commonly, many surgeries are combined into a single operation. A abdominoplasty and breast lift is often done together. This may be called a “Mommy Makeover”. The prices will vary depending on geographic region, surgeon reputation, and our specific needs.</p><p>In NYC, a abdominoplasty and a breast lift will cost around $12,000 each. Usually discounts are given when these two surgeries are combined so you will save several thousand dollars. </p><p>This may seem expensive, but remember, you are getting a breast and tummy makeover all in one surgery.</p><p></p>

<p><i>Mommy makeover procedure costs</i><br>
The procedures that encompass a mommy makeover can be variable but generally falls into a combined abdominoplasty (removing excess abdominal skin) procedure and breast procedure (augmentation, lift or both).</p><p>Your plastic surgeon can talk to you about your specific concerns and give you a personalized recommendation for an operation that would give you the best results.

<li>the combined procedure can range from $11000-13500 depending on the above factors.</li>
