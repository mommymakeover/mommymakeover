However what is your contingency plan if you need another surgry for unwanted results or complications.</p><p>Lately, I heard they are charging 20%. (Samir Shureih, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Credit choices are available</h3><p>At our office we use Care Credit and Capitol One, each offers alternatives.</p><p>Most of our patients have been satisfied with their service. (Jeffrey Zwiren, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Care Credit or CapitalOne</h3><p>Plastic surgery has many things that may be overhyped, or promise too much without delivery! The cost for good or bad procedures can be rather steep.</p><p>But the great news is that CareCredit and CapitalOne are two reputable companies with many different plans that suite your financing goals.</p><p>As with any financing plan, be sure that the payments do not make it difficult for you to pay for your essential daily needs. (Robert M. Freund, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_530" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>We use Care Credit and Capital One. You can often get interest-free or low interest loans spread out over varying lengths of time. (William Groff, DO, San Diego Dermatologist)</p><h3>Carecredit is my favorite</h3><p>I work with carecredit. obviously there are many other reputable companies out there, however make sure you read the fine line and avoid any inflated fees. I have seen some companies charge many inflated fees, and just make sure you read the fine print before signing any documents.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_531" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I have also worked with surgery loans which had a good reputation as well. (Marwan R. Khalifeh, MD, Chevy Chase Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Financing for aesthetic surgery.</h3><p>Care Credit is one of the more popular financial institutions with a focus on the plastic surgery filed. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Care Credit and Chase financing are the two I know of. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You may have more recovery time, (and time off work). In the very rare instance, you may have to back to the O.R. (for bleeding, etc;).</p><p>Best to ask your plastic surgeon who he/she uses. Take your time and decide. Remember this is elective surgery.</p><p>You do not need to rush into something without doing research and asking questions. (Jeffrey Roth, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CareCredit seems reputable.</h3><p>My patients have almost exclusively used Care Credit when they are financing a loan for their plastic surgery. CareCredit is is a part of GE Capital financing (and they have been around for a long time).</p><p>My experience with many of the other “medical loan” companies has not been so favorable.</p><p>The patient’s loan interest rates can be very high and some of the loan companies also charge the surgeon a large percentage of the loan amount up front. (Douglas J. Raskin, MD, DMD, Colorado Springs Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Plastic surgery financing</h3><p>CareCredit is the most reputable and largest cosmetic surgery financing company in the US. You can receive approval online in a matter of minutes and most plastic surgeons offer this type of financing.</p><p>You can locate them online or consult with a local plastic surgeon for more information. (William Bruno, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Reputable Lenders</h3><p>Good medical financing companies are getting harder to find as some of the reputable ones like Chase Health Advance have left the field. CareCredit is still the leader. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>When looking to finance your cosmetic surgery, you should always look for reputable companies. In Canada there are two companies that specialize in cosmetic procedures: Medicard and CreditMedical.</p><p>In addition to these, you can always go to your bank and request a loan or a line of credit (which in fact may have a better rate then Medicard/CreditMedical).</p><p>Shop around for the best rate but avoid shady businesses. (and remember. the best rate is 0%. when you save up for your procedure. the worst rate is your credit card) Sincerely, Martin Jugenburg, MD (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Plastic Surgery Financing</h3><p>Care Credit is probably the most popular company for plastic surgical loans. We have found them ethical and have few complaints from our patients. The most important thing is making sure you can afford the loan conditions and realize in the long run you of course are paying more due to the interest than waiting, saving up and paying the whole amount when you have sufficient funds available.</p><p>Many women set up a banking account separate from their other monies to save for such an occasion. (Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Options for Plastic Surgery financing Montreal</h3><p>In Montreal Plastic Surgery financing can be obtained through two main providers, both highly reputable. These are Medicard and Credit Medical. They both offer flexible plans and can usually approve a patient within 24 hours of their application.</p><p>Their interest rates vary according to a patient’s credit history but are not unreasonable. Many of our patients have used these plastic surgery financing plans with success. (Arie Benchetrit, MD, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Paying for plastic surgery.</h3><p>Financing plastic surgery procedures is a relatively common occurrence today. In years past, patients dipped into their home equity or other sources of equity to finance plastic surgery.</p><p>The most common and most reputable credit/financing companies for plastic surgery are CareCredit and Chase CapitalOne. You will have to judge for yourself the benefit of taking on debt to finance plastic surgery. It may be a good investment for you but you will have to make sure that you are:</p><ol>
<li>well informed with regards to the terms of the loan</li>
<li>are able to comfortably pay for the loan</li>
<li>not adding an unnecessary financial stress to your life now or in the future should your income or financial responsibilities change. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>Care credit or credit cards</h3><p>Your best bet is either using Care Credit, the leader in the industry, or a low APR credit card.</p><p>If you can be vigilant and keep a watchful eye out in the mail for introductory credit card offers, you can have APR rates that are extremely low using a credit card.</p><p>It may involve starting with one card then transferring the balance to another card before the introductory rates expire, so a fair amount of work can be involved.</p><p>If you are not interested in that kind of work, Care credit will not offer quite as low rates but will be easier to manage on a monthly basis. (Robert Steely, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I offer care credit and surgery loans through the office. Credit cards are also accepted. I advise the patients to only perform the surgery if the know they are fully able to pay the loan before they are roped into the abyss where they are paying 35% interest.</p><p>I am helping with financing the patient through all of these services (Norman Bakshandeh, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Carecredit.com is a reputable financing company</h3><p>In my office we use carecredit.com when patients are interested in financing. They are good about extending credit and they have attractive rates.</p><p>But remember, its important to be realistic about what you can afford prior to going forward with a procedure. (Jason E. Leedy, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Care Credit is a company that many plastic surgeons use, and our patients often apply for financing through this lender. As with any financing or credit card, it is very important to understand the payoff options and interest rates, especially if there is an initial interest-free time period.</p><p>Your plastic surgeon’s office staff should be able to help guide you through this process. (Michelle A. Spring, MD, FACS, Missoula Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CareCredit is hands down the most reputable lender for cosmetic surgery. The application process is fast and easy. I keep a link on my website for patients to use. Approval only takes a few minutes. They have several payback options. Be sure to pay off any balances on the plans that offer 0% in the time allotted or you make end up paying for interest from the beginning. (Martin O’Toole, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my clinic we have been working with a Medical Financing company for some years now and it is a great place they lend you the money for surgery and then with months you pay them back or depending the agreement you have with them but usually this is how it works we have not had any complaints they are a very good company. Regards ! (Luis Suarez, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Care Credit for Plastic Surgery Financing</h3><p>A very popular lender for cosmetic surgery is Care Credit. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are several companies that finance plastic surgery including mommy makeover, including care credit and Capital One. patients can also use their credit card which offers initial reduced rates for financing their plastic surgery. (S. Sean Younai, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon</p><h3>Plastic Surgery Financing</h3><p>My practice has had a very good experience with care credit. We recommend it to all patients exploring financing options as it comes with several low interest options and even a few zero interest options.</p><p>They have excelllent customer service and ease of use. If not approved, some patients will perform the part of the procedure they most desire, then come back for a second procedure when they reach a better financial situation. (Paul S. Gill, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The finance company I am most familiar with is Care Credit. They have provided loans for cosmetic surgery for many years and are a reputable company. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We use care credit for all of our patients that need financing. They have different plans from 0% interest to extended plans with a 14.9% interest rate. (Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>There are many reliable financing options in Denver</h3><p>The most well-known dedicated cosmetic surgery financing option is through CareCredit, which I offer at my own practice, and there are a few others as well.</p><p>However, many patients use a regular low-interest credit card to pay for their procedure, or split the total between lenders.</p><p>Regardless of which option you choose, be sure you read the fine print so you understand exactly the terms to which you’re agreeing.</p><p>Remember, there’s always the option of saving up over a period of several months until you can pay for your procedure in cash up front, which can save hundreds of dollars in interest on payments that would otherwise add up over time. (Frank Campanile, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Surgical procedures for aesthetic purposes, to improve appearance, are not covered by insurance. Typically, these as well as complications resulting from such procedures are the responsibility of the patient.</p><p>CareCredit is one financing company that may help you, if you qualify. (Lewis Albert Andres, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>My practice uses Care Credit exclusively. They are reputable, transparent and my patients have not had any complaints or problems with them. (Niki Christopoulos, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Care Credit offers reputable, reliable financing for cosmetic plastic surgery and procedures. (Ralph Trey Aquadro, MD, Auburn Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Financing options in Denver</h3><p>There are several options available, with Care Credit being one of the more common. As with any loan or credit card, always read the fine print and make sure you understand the consequences of things like missing or late payments. In general, I would advise patients to create a savings plan (similar to the financing payment plan) and put surgery off for some time as opposed to taking debt upon themselves. However, financing is a personal decision and taken on a case by case basis. (Bryan Correa, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The best medical loan lender I’ve used is. Care credit. They are easy to use work well with my staff and the costs are reasonable. (Frank J. Ferraro, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CareCredit is a reputable lender for cosmetic surgery procedures. Many of the patients use this company. We have had a relationship with them for years and no problems. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are a lot of options out there, however, our office has used CareCredit the most. It seems the most reliable and consistently happy patients. (Alfred Sofer, MD, FACS, Fairfield Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Denver Financing option</h3><p>We have worked with Credit Medical and Crelogix in Canada and have found them to be pretty convenient for both us and the patient. (Jerome Edelstein, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The top lender in my practice is CareCredit. Make sure that you carefully review the financing terms and interest rates for each option. (Jeremy A. Benedetti, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Financing your cosmetic surgery</h3><p>Financing your cosmetic surgery has become increasingly popular. There are some great lenders available. I participate with Alphaeon Credit and CareCredit and highly recommend these companies. They have low interest rates available as well as budget friendly plans.</p><p>We also accept Enhance Patient Financing and MedicalFinancing.com. Lots of options but not all physicians participate with the same companies. I definitely recommend finding a physician that you like and trust and then investigate their financing options. (Alan N. Larsen, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Financing for cosmetic surgery in Denver</h3><p>It sounds like you are financially savvy and willing to do your homework. I have had patients use Care Credit in my practice. That said, make sure you read all the fine print and are careful to avoid missing any payments to prevent hefty interest penalties. Cosmetic surgery should be an experience that makes you feel good – cutting finances too tight will interfere with enjoying your new look. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Plastic Surgery Financing</h3><p>There are many options to finance plastic surgery, but you must be careful and do your research before committing to anything.</p><p>In my practice, we use Carecredit and Alphaeon Financing. Both of these lenders have an excellent track record and take great care of our patients. (Juan A. Brou, MD, Oklahoma City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are many reputable medical financing companies (in our region there are Crelogix, Credit Medical, Medicard and others).</p><p>I have had patients use all of these firms and have not had negative feedback. That stated, the companies have different interest rates and loan terms, so it is well worth your time to check out multiple lenders before making a commitment. (William Andrade, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Financing Plastic Surgery</h3><p>Financing for plastic surgery can be accomplished with many lenders and banks. We use Care Credit in my practice.</p><p>They have options for interest free payments which is very attractive for our clients. We also accept most major credit cards for payment. (Stephen J. Vega, MD, Rochester Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Financing Options</h3><p>We accept both Care Credit & Medical Financing in my office. Care Credit is more like a medical credit card and Medical Financing (previously known as Surgery Loans) is more of an actual loan. (Jimmy S. Firouz, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Financing mommy makeover surgery</h3><p>There are many options when it comes to financing your surgery. For instance, there are companies that can facilitate a 24-60 month extended payment plans which can make your monthly payments as low as $79.</p><p>In case your credit history is brand new, these companies also allow co-signers. As you can see, there are a few alternatives to be considered. Here are some helpful hints: If you have good credit, Care Credit offers 6 and 12mo. no interest payment plans as well as 24-60mo. extended payment plans at a fixed interest rate of 14.9%. They also accept co-signors.</p><p>Medical Financing and also EFINANCE Solutions work with people who have A, B and C credit and can approve you at different qualifying interest rates, they too accept co-signors. I look forward to helping you with any questions that may facilitate your choice in applying with a company. (Leonard Hochstein, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Care Credit has been used in my practice for several years as a financing resource for patients. I have not heard of any complaints and patients seem satisfied (John Zavell, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cosmetic Surgery Financing Options</h3><p>There are an array of ways to finance your cosmetic surgery procedure.
