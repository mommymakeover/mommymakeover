Usually this long of a surgery takes some advance planning from the surgeons perspective.</p><p>In our office, this often means abour 4-6 wks depending on the time of year. I agree with the other surgeons on this board – see the physician first, make sure that there is a comfort level on both sides (between you and the surgeon, and between the surgeon and yourself).</p><p>Worry about how expedicious the surgery can be scheduled as a secondary concern. (Eric Chang, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>That all depends on how busy the surgeon is that you consult with. We are typically booked for at least 6-8 weeks. Occasionally a patient may have a personal conflict or reason that they need to postpone their surgery, so occasionally an earlier opening may develop.</p><p>Also, after the first consultation, you need to have a physical examination by your medical doctor as well as blood work. Sometimes it takes time to get an appointment with your medical doctor to get these things done.</p><p>In my practice I always see patients for a second or pre-op consultation to go over other details about having surgery, how to prepare as well as to answer any other questions which you may have come up with since the first consultation. (Daniel P. Markmann, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most good surgeons would want to see you more than one time to make sure you fully understand the operations, their risks, their benefits and their recovery.</p><p></p>

</div>If you are in good health and are a good candidate for the operation, the rapidity of scheduling would then depend on the surgeon’s schedule and the availability of the surgical facility. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)
<p>That depends on the availability of your PS and if you are in good health. Breast implants can take on average a week to 2 weeks. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The time it takes do do a mommy makeover is significant on a surgeon’s schedule and depends on what you are doing and how to prepare for mommy makeover surgery.</p><p>There would usually be a few weeks to months before having it done. I’d be worried if they could do it very quickly as it would probably indicate that they weren’t busy and that doesn’t speak well of the practice. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>During the intial consultation, we pinpoint the areas that need to be addressed in the mommy makeover, whether it be your abdomen, stomach, or both. The timing of the operation depends on how healthy you are.</p><p></p>

</div>We would want you to have stopped breastfeeding for at least a year, and make sure you have help at home, not only for someone to take care of you, but to take care of your little ones, as you will not be able to lift anything greater than 10 lbs, push, or pull with your arms for 6 weeks.
<p>Also, if you have any medical issues or are older than 40, you would also need medical clearance, provided by your primary medical doctor. </p><p>So, looking at the timeline, a week to 2 weeks after the intial consultation may be reasonable. (Jennifer Buck, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>Depending on the availability of your surgeon and the operating room, your procedure can often be performed within a few weeks of your initial consultation. It is important to undergo a safe preoperative evaluation prior to any elective cosmetic surgery.
<p>It is important to have an up to date mammogram if you are of age, and to undergo any appropriate laboratory workup. If everything checks out, you should be able to schedule surgery rather quickly. A word of caution, I do encourage you to base your decision on the reputation and work of your surgeon, not how quickly they can schedule your surgery. (Paul S. Gill, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>If you have a specific surgical date in mind, you must first see one or more board-certified plastic surgeons to decide on whom you wish to perform your surgery, what exactly will be done, how to prepare for mommy makeover surgery or other activities, as well as time to have a preoperative physical and lab tests, arrange for help after surgery, and make preparations at home (ice bags, head of bed elevated or recliner chair, food in the freezer, etc.).
<p>I have out-of-state patients who prearrange everything prior to the consultation, after which surgery that has been tentatively scheduled can be performed at the prescheduled date. Of course, either the patient or I have full veto power over proceeding if either of us feels that it is not appropriate to proceed, for ANY reason! </p><p></p>

</div>That way there is no pressure, but everything can be prearranged to fit a patient’s schedule if indeed we both decide to proceed. Most do, and this works quite well. I do have the luxury of owning my own accredited surgical facility, so I do not have to coordinate with a facility’s or hospital’s schedule, nor do I ever have a patient’s surgery “bumped” by an emergency C-section, trauma patient, or other physician’s emergency surgery.
<p><strong>Best advic</strong>e: call one or more plastic surgeons’ offices and see what they say. Do your homework and listen to your chosen surgeon! (Richard H. Tholen, MD, FACS, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>It is hard to predict how to prepare for mommy makeover surgery. It depends upon how busy the surgeon is, and what type of work-up you need pre-op to schedule surgery. 
<p>The earliest is probaably two weeks, but I wouldn’t wait until the last minute to get the appointment. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your question’s answer is not dependent on us the expert posters but the chosen surgeon’s schedule</p><p>You first concern should be to choose the experinced well trained , board certified plastic surgeon. Meet the plastic surgeon in consultation make sure he/she has all the credentials. and discuss your desires and see if the surgeon can deliver what you need and the two personalities work well. THEN YOU CAN DISCUSS TIME FOR THE SURGERY. (Samir Shureih, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>The time between the consultation and surgery depends on many factors, including your surgeon’s schedule, availability of the surgical facility, and when you can complete your pre-surgical medical clearance. Your board-certified plastic surgeon is the best person to let you know how to prepare for mommy makeover surgery. (Arnold S. Breitbart, MD, FACS, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)
<p>The timing between a consultation and any plastic surgery procedure can be variable and is affected by numerous factors. Besides the obvious schedules of the plastic surgeon and the patient, other important factors include the need for any preoperative laboratory tests and the availability of the facility where the procedure is to be performed.</p><p></p>

</div>In my Indianapolis plastic surgery practice, service to the patient and the consideration of their schedule and timing needs takes priority. Patients can get on the schedule as fast as they are able to get everything lined up and all tests and paperwork done. (Barry L. Eppley, MD, DMD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Some times I am booked for months and other times it can be scheduled quickly. If you are interested in coming up to NY give my office a call. (William B. Rosenblatt, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most busy plastic surgeons are booked out weeks in advance. Sure, a 1 or 2 hour case can easily be added on to accomodate a patient. However, mommy makeover procedures are usually combined breast and tummy surgeries. In addition, you may need an a medicine clearance depending on your health status. </p><p></p>

</div>In addition, you may want to visit more than one plastic surgeon. Once you have selected your board certified plastic surgeon, talk to his/her staff to see if they can accomodate your scheduling needs. (C. Bob Basu, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)
<p>If you are appropriate for the procedure or procedures that you want you can be scheduled as soon as the arrangements can be made. (Walter D. Gracia, MD, Fort Worth Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In most cases after a consultation, it may take several weeks to actually have the surgery. </p><p></p>

</div>However, it all really depends on the length of the procedure, the operating room availability and the surgeon’s schedule.
<p>After your consultation, you will likely need to have a medical clearance exam by your primary care doctor and may need to have some blood tests or other studies to make sure you are healthy for surgery. Cosmetic plastic surgery is elective, so every precaution is taken to ensure patient safety prior to the procedure. (David Shafer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You can get the mommy makeover as soon as the scheduling between the surgeon’ s availability and surgical facility permits. This could be days if there is a last minute cancellation or weeks. (Dana Khuthaila, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>There is no absolute time. It is a matter of scheduling. It may be limited by the doctor or the facility’s schedules. Arrangments have to be made to make sure it is safe. You have to be off anti-inflamatory drugs like asprin etc for about 2 weeks. These are some of the factors. (Rodney A. Green, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)
<h3>Recovery time planning is important for Mommy Makeover procedures</h3><p>I would add that the recovery time necessary for a Mommy Makeover that includes a tummy tuck is substantial. Its not a ‘weekend’ recovery. I tell my tummy tuck patients to plan on taking off 2 weeks from work and having some help around the house for at least the first week. Rushing into a mommy Makeover procedure without proper time management planning is a big mistake. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>If you have no past medical history that would preclude you from having surgery and you have been cleared by your physician with requisite labs and an ECG, you may proceed with your procedure relatively soon (within days), scheduling usually being the rate limiting step. Other things that may delay your procedure include recent use of NSAIDS (aspirin, ibuprofen). Consult with your surgeon to discuss all these details. Warmest Regards, Glenn Vallecillos, M.D., F.A.C.S. (Glenn Vallecillos, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)
<h3>Mommy makeover surgery scheduling</h3><p>The time from your consultation to surgery depends on whether you may need to loose some weight, what preop medical evaluation and testing you need, what surgeries your will have as your mommy makeover, the surgeon’s schedule, and your schedule. Longer procedure times usually require some weeks to book, whereas shorter procedures may sometimes be added to an already existing schedule and can be done on shorter notice.</p><p></p>

</div>The key concern is not the rapidity of scheduling, but your safety, These are elective procedures, there is no need to rush into them. After your consultation, you should consider the surgeons suggestions, his answers to your questions, what if any, additional question you may have as well as your preoperative medical preparations. (Fredrick A. Valauri, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)
<h5>Depending on circumstances, a mommy makeover is possible right after the consultation.</h5><p>Patients are selected for surgery with their safety as the premier consideration. Once it is established that the patient is a good candidate for any combination of “mommy makeover” operations, the surgeon may proceed. There are many facets to this conclusion which precludes a full answer to the question in this forum. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Mommy makeover planning</h4><p></p>

</div>Most plastic surgeons will want to see you in consultation and develop a plan based on your specific goals. The next step is a pre-operative visit, typically about 10-14 days before tha surgery.
<p>You don’t want to rush any of this since it takes time to make sure you are comfortable with the informed consent process (risks and alternatives) as well as implant size if that is part of the plan. There may also be arrangements for help at home that need to be made. (Richard Baxter, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I don’t think you should rush into surgery, but make sure you find a plastic surgeon who is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and someone you feel comfortable with.</p><p>From there, depending on your surgeon’s schedule and whether they have operating room time available, you can select a date for surgery, maybe within about 10-14 days to give you time to get your preoperative workup done. (Jason Brett Lichten, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The time frame after consultation will depend on your surgeons availability, and your health and preparation.</p></div>
