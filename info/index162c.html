</div>In patients, interest in mommy makeover is caused, first of all, by the ability to quickly restore prenatal body shapes, and sometimes improve them.
<p>Experts say that the popularity of simultaneous operations after childbirth is due to the following features of modern society:</p><ul>
<li>The age of women, who give birth for the first time, is often 35-45 years;</li>
<li>Increase in the number of multiple pregnancies;</li>
<li>Tendency to increasing the number of births;</li>
<li>High level of social activity of women aged 40-50;</li>
<li>Slender appearance.</li>
</ul><p></p>

</div>According to the surgeons observations, the patients who underwent abdominoplasty and mammoplasty after the first birth and decided to give birth again, are subjectively noted after repeated delivery that their body condition is much better than it was in the previous case.
<h3>What a woman wants after giving birth</h3><p>Patients wishing to obtain a perfect body after birth by a simultaneous operation usually expect the following corrective interventions:</p><ul>
<li>Change in the shape and volume of the breast, correction of mastoptosis;</li>
<li>Abdominoplasty, the plication of the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall;</li>
<li>Liposuction;</li>
<li>Lipomatosis of the flank, thigh;</li>

<li>Lipomatosis of the back;</li>
<li>Correction of the shape of the buttocks;</li>
<li>Labioplasty;</li>
<li>Correction of the scar after cesarean section, striae on the abdomen.</li>
</ul><p>However, sometimes a woman performs only correction of the breasts, abdomen and thighs, postponing the rest to a later period.</p><p>It should be noted that just such a volume of surgical intervention (abdominoplasty, liposuction, mammoplasty) is recommended today by the clinics of aesthetic surgery as an integrated Mommy makeover approach .</p><h3>Possible risks of Mommy makeover complex after childbirth</h3><p></p>

</div>Usually it is difficult to convince a patient who decided to completely change after the birth, according to the Mommy makeover principle, that for her health it is advisable not to rush into the global surgical interventions, but rather to adjust the figure in stages.
<p>Experts say that in the postpartum period, the woman is not even afraid of the fact that after the simultaneous operation she is undergoing swelling of almost the entire body, a large number of all kinds of drainage and brightly manifested scars in the body. Patients want to have everything at once, here and now, regardless of the likely risks.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is desirable for a doctor to avoid such simultaneous operations that last more than 4.5 hours at a time. Perhaps, it should be explained in detail to the patient that such operations are very difficult and are conducted under general anesthesia.</p><p></p>

</div>For a long time the body not only experiences the action of considerable doses of drugs and not only undergoes interventions in the form of deeply inserted arterial and venous catheters and other instruments.
<p>For many hours, most vital functions are turned off and controlled by an anesthesiologist, and the body experiences severe trauma in the form of a multitude of incisions and various internal manipulations. </p><p>In this case, the body is significantly weakened after childbirth, and therefore the risks of various postoperative complications increase dramatically.</p><p>The patient should be offered a variant of body correction in stages. After six months or a year after breast augmentation or abdominoplasty, consult a surgeon for liposuction or correction of the hips and buttocks.</p><p>The American Society of Plastic Surgeons encourages surgeons to pay special attention to patients after giving birth, who bring their best photos taken before pregnancy and wish to get the same result. Such attention should take into account the peculiar mental state of a woman in the early postpartum period, but at the same time, surgical interventions that could harm a patient’s health should be avoided.</p><h3>Loose Skin After Pregnancy Solution!</h3><p>There are a number of procedures that can be performed after pregnancy to address loose skin. They are often combined in what many call a “Mommy Makeover.” This typically can involve a Tummy Tuck as well as breast surgery such as a lift, reduction, or augmentation. Determining your individual goals with your surgeon can help you find which procedures are the best option for you. </p><p>A Mommy Makeover can remove a significant amount of excess abdominal skin particularly if there is not a great deal of adipose (fatty) tissue present (both under the skin and around the stomach). Many women who have stretch marks present beneath their umbilicus are able to have them removed in the process. Depending on the degree of ptosis (sagging), a mastopexy (breast lift) or augmentation is done concurrently to address the breast loose skin. </p><p>See a board certified plastic surgeon near you to discuss the procedure in detail. A mommy makeover will include excision of extra skin around your midsection, repair of the abdominal muscles to improve any bulge you may have, as well as lift your breasts and improve their fullness. </p><h3>Sagging Skin after pregnancy</h3><p>Saggy skin after pregnancy assuming it is in the abdominal area. A tummy tuck will take care if this problem. On addition, your abdominal, muscles are tightened up as well. </p><p>The tummy tuck component of the mommy makeover will address loose skin on the abdomen. The excess skin is removed, the muscle is tightened and stretch marks on the lower abdomen can be removed. Consult a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon for a full consultation and exam.</p><p>Find a surgeon you trust with experience who can show you many before and after photos. “Mommy makeover” refers to a combination of different cosmetic procedures that can be done at the same setting to counteract all of the changes that have occurred from pregnancy. The precise combination depends on the areas that were damaged and can vary from one patient to another.</p><p>Excess skin on the abdomen almost always requires a tummy tuck to correct. Loose sagging skin on the breasts may require an implant, a lift, or a combinationof both to fill out and trim the redundant skin. Other procedures are available for skin of the thighs and arms if they are an issue.</p><p>The best way to figure out which combination of procedures you would need to address your unique issues is to be evaluated by a Board certified plastic surgeon. Then you can get on your way to losing that saggy skin. </p><h3>Mommy Makeover for Loose Skin.</h3><p>A mommy makeover is designed to get rid of the extra skin that often occurs after pregnancy. The tummy tuck will remove the excess skin of the abdomen and the breast lift will get rid of extra skin of the breasts (sometimes, it can just be filled out with an implant). Choose your board-certified plastic surgeon, carefully. I’m sure you’ll be happy. </p><p>Mommy Makeover comprises a spectrum of procedures that lift and tighten the breast and abdomen, removing sagging skin.</p><p>Loose sagging skin in the breast may be treated with a breast lift, removing excess skin to tighten the breast. Implants may also achieve that result, and some do best with a combination of lifting and augmentation.</p><p>Loose sagging skin in the abdomen is best treated with tummy tuck – there’s no other therapy to address loose skin.</p><h3>Mommy Makeover Surgery Information Guide:</h3></div></div></article>
