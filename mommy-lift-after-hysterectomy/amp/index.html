They may be done any time after a woman has given birth and has recovered from her pregnancy. In our practice we have done many mommy makeovers in combination with other surgeries such as a hysterectomy.</p><p>When considering this combination, be sure to visit with a experienced board-certified plastic surgeon who has experience doing these procedures simultaneously and also has a good relationship with gynecologists that may perform a hysterectomy at the same time.</p><p>Our patients have found it convenient to combine the recovery processes of these three surgeries at once. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>While it is possible to do a hysterectomy simultaneously or before a mommy makeover, I would suggest coordinating your gynecologist with your plastic surgeon to make sure they are on the same page and the incision is optimal for both especially if it is done abdominally rather than vaginally.</p><p>I have done these surgeries at the time of a gynecological procedure but you must discuss the sequence and timing of the procedures and the possible risks that might be higher than doing them separately. Also, you must discuss what happens if the surgery needs to be curtailed. (Robin T.W. Yuan, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A hysterectomy should not affect an abdominoplasty, tummy tuck, breast surgery or liposuction. Often a tummy tuck can be performed using the same incision as the gynecologist. This should be coordinated by the surgeons involved in your care.</p><p></p>

</div>I would perform the breast surgery and liposuction as a separate procedure. However, a tummy tuck and umbilical hernia repair can be performed with hysterectomy and should be discussed with your plastic surgeon.
<p>A tummy tuck, breast surgery and liposuction can also be performed separately after the hysterectomy. The plastic surgeon can use the same incisional scar for the tummy tuck as the gynecologist. All of the options should be discussed with your plastic surgeon. (Andrew Turk, MD, Naples Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you can get your gynecologist and your plastic surgeon to coordinate the procedures, there is no reason you could not have them concurrently, although the length of the procedure may elevate your surgical risk.</p><p>If the two are to be staged, I would also recommend having the hysterectomy first, unless it can be done vaginally, in order to not have the concern that the hysterectomy will diminish the result of your tummy tuck. (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>A hysterectomy is commonly performed with a bilareral oophorectomy (ovary removal). This may trigger surgical menopause and in some cases this is associated with weight gain.
<p>Combination and prolonged procedures under anesthesia particularly those that involve the pelvic structutres are associated with a higher risk of deep venous thrombosis. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Hysterectomy could affect tummy tuck results</i></p><p>A hysterectomy after a tummy tuck could damage the result. I would have the hysterectomy first and then follow with the tummy tuck. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A hystory should not affect your cosmetic resuts of mommy makeover. You may want to have this done at another time, as you are looking at a lot of surgery. If you do this as a second stage, they may be able to do it vaginally, or laporoscopicaly. (Scott E. Kasden, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Hysterectomy and plastic surgery</b></p><p>Your hysterectomy will not effect your ability to have an optimum result from a Mommy Makeover. A tummy tuck only deals with excess abdominal skin and torn abdominal musculature. Your uterus, of course, is an internal organ. (Howard T. Bellin, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It isn’t clear whether you are thinking of having the hysterectomy before, during or after the mommy makeover. Any of these three can be done without significantly affecting the cosmetic result. Just make sure your plastic surgeon and gynecologist are comfortable with the plan. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Hysterectomy and mommy makeover</i></p><p>I am not quite sure what you are asking. Are you concerned about the timing? Can they be done at the same time? While they can be done at the same time if the hysterectomy is being performed for benign disease, it can increase the risks of complications. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Can a hysterectomy be combined with a tummy tuck?</h3><p></p>

</div>I’m assuming you are asking if a hysterectomy can be done at the same time as a tummy tuck? The answer is yes. You need to be healthy enough for both procedures. Please visit with a board certified plastic surgeon who works with your OB/GYN. (C. Bob Basu, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)
<p><i>A Hysterectomy should NOT affect Tummy Tuck results</i></p><p>Unless you have a very large fibroid uterus, a hysterectomy would not affect the results of a Tummy Tuck. Although a hysterectomy is done together with a Mommy Make Over Tummy Tuck, a trans-vaginal hysterectomy may be a bit safer than a (trans abdominal) hysterectomy because vaginal bacteria are not potentially exposed to the entire surface of the abdomen. </p><p>Since the hysterectomy will take between one and two hours, this time needs to be taken into consideration when planning several OTHER operations. The total time under anesthesia would determine the operative risk. </p><p>I would therefore advise you to have the hysterectomy first and the Mommy Make Over (in your case, Tummy Tuck with umbilical hernia repair, Breast Augmentation Lift and Liposuction) later. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I agree with a lot of what has already been said. One of the things you mention is repair of an umbilical hernia. This is something that most plastic surgeons are equipped to handle. If your hysterectomy can be done vaginally, then the hernia repair can be done during the tummy tuck. I feel, as do some of the other surgeons, that to do it all at the same time carries more risk. It makes sense to do the hysterectomy first, and then come back at another time for the mommy makeover. (Paul W. Loewenstein, MD, Milwaukee Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Hysterectomy scars and abdominoplasty</strong></p><p>No, it will not. In fact, the hysterectomy scar will likely be removed at the same time and replaced with a lower scar that is easier to hide under your undergarments. They can be done at the same operation but if possible it is better to do them at separate operations to decrease the risk of infection or other problems. (Aaron Stone, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Hysterectomy not impediment for tummy tuck</em></p><p></p>

</div>It is not unusual for many of my patients that request/undergo a tummy-tuck to have had in the past either a c-section, gall-bladder surgery, or abdominal hysterectomy. Typically these prior procedures are not an impediment towards undergoing an abdominoplasty procedure. I hope this helps, (Sergio Pasquale Maggi, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Hysterectomy will not affect your cosmetic surgery much. If the hysterectomy is done after the tummy tuck, then make sure your gynecologist uses the same abdominoplasty incision and suture or tighten the muscles well. OR Do hysterectomy and abdominoplasty, then breast lift and augmentation and liposuction. (Samir Shureih, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I agree with the other doctors responses. Having a hysterectomy will not affect your results of the mommy makeover, except if the hysterectomy is done after the mommy makeover and the scar from the hysterectomy doe not heal as well as the plastic surgeons scar from the tummy tuck. </p><p>You may want to consider having the hysterectomy at the same time as the tummy tuck portion and then having the breast done later. (Robert B. Pollack, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A hysterectomy should not affect your results, as the incision for this can be made in the same location as your tummy tuck incision. I would advise against having a hysterectomy at the same time as your breast and liposuction surgery, but it is certainly possible in conjunction with a tummy tuck.</p><p><i>Hysterectomy affect Mommy Makeover results</i></p><p>Anything can happen so to answer the question specifically, why not do the hysterectomy first? Than you should be concerned if the result of your mommy make over will be effected. (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Hysterectomy prior to plastic surgery</i></p><p>No, a hysterectomy should not affect your plastic surgery results. Are you wanting to have the surgery at the same time as your plastic surgery? If so, you may want to separate your procedures to a few different times instead of trying to push to have all the procedures at the same time as your hysterectomy. Good luck.
