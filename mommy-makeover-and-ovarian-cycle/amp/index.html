Review with your surgeon to be certain.</p><p>As far as pain, patients are surprised that a tummy tuck is not necessarily very painful.  In our no drain technique using long-acting local anesthetic, the patients do extremely well. (Francisco Canales, MD, Santa Rosa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Do not worry – this happens much more commonly than you might think – and is absolutely fine.  Likely no problem to proceed.  Most plastic surgeries do not involve a significant amount of blood loss and are therefore not affected by ovarian cycle.</p><p>That being said it never hurts to mention this to your plastic surgeon – especially if you have unusually heavy periods. (Christopher J. Davidson, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Surgery can still be performed if you are menstrauting. There is no evidence that ovarian cyclehas an adverse affect during surgery. (Jeffrey Weinzweig, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is perfectly fine to have surgery while you are menstruating. It will not affect your recovery or your results. Inform your surgeon so that he/she is aware of it. (Brian K. Reedy, MD, Reading Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Ovarian cycle doesnot impact your procedure the day of surgery or the results of your procedure in any capacity. It is not possible to predict if your pain will be more or less than after a C-section because every patient experiences pain differently.</p><p>Pain medication will assist with alleviating any pain and discomfort you may experience post procedure. The expected recovery time is six to eight weeks post surgery.</p><p></p>

</div>Most patients can return to a sedentary job 8-14 days and can begin full impact activities 4 weeks post surgery. You can expect to require more sleep and to experience fatigue after daily routine activities. 
<p>Every patient’s recovery is unique and it is important to listen to your body. (Scott Chapin, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It shouldn’t be a problem that you have your period. Just make sure to wear a pad rather than a tampon.</p><p>You may feel a little more “out of it” after surgery just because most people tend to be a little more sensitive while they’re on their period.Pain is really a subjective thing.</p><p>However most patients agree that recovering from a C-section is more painful and difficult compared to recovering from a tummy-tuck. (Leila Kasrai, MD, FRCSC, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

<strong>Ovarian cycle is not a contraindication to cosmetic surgery</strong> – while some patients report being a bit more uncomfortable after surgery than patients not menstruating, it is perfectly fine to undergo a procedure. (Robert Steely, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Ovarian cycle is not a contraindication of any surgery , unless it is a excessive bleeding. </p><p>You must tell your surgeon that you have ovarian cycle in order to take actions in the operating room . (Derby Sang Caputo, MD, Dominican Republic Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Surgery can safely be performed during ovarian cycle. Most people would tell you that a C-section is more painful than an abdominoplasty. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>It is okay to have plastic surgery while menstruating. Interestingly, a recent study showed increased risk of bleeding and wound healing issues  in menstruating patients undergoing surgery.  (Sara Yegiyants, MD, FACS, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)
<p>It is ok to have proceed with your plastic surgery procedure during ovarian cycle. Ovarian cycle just before plastic surgery is very common and have no effect on complication or outcome in out practice.</p><p>There is no reason to alter your plans. However, ask your your surgeon. Your best plastic surgeon has the experience, training, and results that relates to you. Do your research and find a real Plastic Surgeon Below are other criteria to use when selecting a Plastic surgeon.</p><h5>Questions to ask your potential plastic surgeon (Answering NO is a big red flag)</h5><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_653" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

<li>Are you a plastic surgeon? (You should research the differences between cosmetic surgeon & plastic surgeon. Make sure that your plastic surgeon is a trained surgeon! You may be surprised)</li>
<li>Are you board certified in Plastic Surgery? (Board certified in what? You are looking for the American Board of Plastic Surgery. There are many boards and some are fake. Make sure that the certifying board is a member board of the American Board of Medical Specialties or the American Osteopathic Association.)</li>
<li>Will the procedure be performed at a fully accredited & certified procedure room or ambulatory surgery center, or hospital</li>
<li>Do you have hospital privilege to perform the same procedure you do in the office? Which Hospital?</li>
<li>Do you offer complication insurance. How do you handle complications and revision (it does happen, it better to be safe) The most important decision is to do your homework well.</li>

</div>Years ago, it was thought that there would be more bleeding during the surgery but most plastic surgeons do not believe this anymore. (Leland Deane, MD, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>Tummy Tuck vs. C-Section discomfort and ovarian cycle</strong><br>
Every patient’s pain tolerance is different and you were probably already prescribed some pain medication for take home use after your surgery.  In my practice, most patients feel quite well, quite quickly and it has been my experience that most patients who have had both a tummy tuck and a c-section do agree that a c-section is a more uncomfortable recovery process when compared to their tummy tuck.  </p><p></p>

</div>With that said, everyone is different and surgical technique or whether or not liposuction wasperformed at the same time will also play a part in your recovery. Ovarian cyclewill not affect your cosmetic surgery result, so don’t worry.  As you have already done, I would recommend informing your surgeon that you are menstruating so that they ensure that you are properly prepared both pre- and post-op. (Stephen T. Greenberg, MD, Woodbury Plastic Surgeon)
<p>This is a very common thing to be menstruating during surgery.  Its perfectly fine nothing to worry about. From what I hear my patients say that the tummy tuck is uncomfortable but not as painful as a C-section.  </p><p></p>

</div>When a tummy tuck is done we are not cutting deep into the different layers which can be painful during recovery. (N. Bill Aydin, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)
<p>I am sitting here not 10 minutes after finishing an armpit submuscular breast augmentation in a 33 year old who was menstruating. There are myths that during your period it is dangerous because of heavier bleeding.Not true.It is embarassing perhaps but it in no way compromises a surgery. (Richard Ellenbogen, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A tummy tuck and breast augmentation done together is a common combination of surgeries to have after childbearing. A lot of patients who have had a c-section and then later had a tummy tuck and breast augmentation say that the c-section is worse….probably because of all of the internal abdominal manipulation needed to get a baby out, and the changing stresses from the end of the pregnancy.</p><p></p>

</div>A tummy tuck does tighten the muscles (which are sore) but it does not cut through them or stir around inside like the c-section does. Expect to need your pain medicines for the first few days, and the muscle relaxer for the augmentation tightness, but they will get better much quicker than they did with the c-section.
<p>As for the ovarian cycle….many patients experience their mensus around the time of their surgery (it throws off your cycle). This is not anything to waste your time worrying about. The risk of bleeding and infection will not change, and the pain of cramps, etc, will be covered by the pain medicines.</p><p>The only thing to be careful about is to NOT use tampons during or after surgery. This is because with the pain medicines and anesthetics in you system it is very likely you will forget how long they are in, and the risk of toxic shock is very real! Use a pad….have your surgery, and you will do fine! (Marie E. Montag, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>First off, you should be reassured to know that this happens to so many patients I’ve decided that the stress of the surgery itself brings on the cycle. 
<p>There is no concern, this is a typical patient consideration that the nurses will help you with. We’re not really even concerned with it any more than we are if you’re having your ovarian cycle.</p><p>It simply doesn’t make a difference. Just go prepared and let the nurse know. There is no scenario where blood is exposed or there is some embarrassing situation as you’re waking up (assuming the nurses in your surgery center are prepared to handle this professionally). It should be part of their daily practice. (Ricardo A. Meade, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>No concerns with surgery during ovarian cycle. Your medical team are professionals and this will not affect anything. (Rodger Shortt, FRCSC, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)
<p>as far as pain goes, it is worse than a c-section, specially if you had liposuction done. But that pain wont last longer than 7-10 days, sometimes less. As far as your period, it’s no contraindication, you can have surgery with it and you’ll be fine. (Luis Tactuk Simo, MD, Dominican Republic Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There should be no problem with undergoing breast augmentation and abdominoplasty while menstruating. Just be sure that your red blood cell count is OK. Most woman would agree that the post-operative pain following abdominoplasty is greater than that of a C-section. Generally, I prescribe patients an oral narcotic analgesic for about two weeks and wean them to non-narcotic analgesics afterwards. Most patients do very well following this regimen. (Paul Fortes, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

<strong>Will being on your period affect your surgery?</strong><br>
There is no evidence to suggest that ovarian cycle just before or during surgery has a bad effect on your surgery. In fact, quite the opposite exists, anesthesia or surgery may cause your menses to begin earlier than expected or it may cause you to miss a period. We can’t explain why one woman reacts in one way and another woman reacts differently. (Sheldon Lincenberg, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)
<p><em>Ovarian cycle should not increase surgery complications</em><br>
Having your period during your scheduled mommy makeover should not be an issue, although you should double check with your practice before surgery to make sure it’s okay to continue taking any over-the-counter painkillers (like Advil), if applicable.</p><p>As for the pain factor of your mommy makeover, most of my patients say recovery after a combination tummy tuck and breast augmentation is far less compared to undergoing a C-section. Of course, pain is subjective and the surgery experience is different for every woman, but many women find the discomfort very manageable after the first few days. (Frank Campanile, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>Your cycle should have no bearing on your surgery. You are OK to proceed as planned. (C. Bob Basu, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)
<p>There is no reason that a person cannot have elective surgery while menstruating. </p><p>You should schedule surgery when it is most convenient for you. (Howard T. Bellin, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Plastic Surgery while menstruating</h5><p>This should not be a problem in most cases.  It is always important to inform your surgeon, anesthesiologist, and the OR team that you are on your period.  </p><p>It is also important that you wear a pad and not an internal tampon.</p><p></p>

</div>As far as the pain goes, I would describe it as different from a c-section. In most cases I would say that the discomfort after tummy tuck is less than a c-section because no muscle is actually being divided or cut. (Josh Waltzman, MD, MBA, Long Beach Plastic Surgeon)
<p><b>Surgery during menses</b><br>
There is no reason you cannot undergo elective surgery, including cosmetic surgeries, during your menses, provided that you are not anemic from unusually heavy flow.  Discuss with you doctor how to manage flow during this time.</p><p>In my practice typically discourage use internal tampon during surgical recovery after tummy tuck or other surgeries that can produce significant swelling of the labial area.  (Jeffrey D. Wagner, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Breast augmentation and tummy tuck while menstruating</h4><p>This is not a significant issue. It happens very often and is not a reason to reschedule. Also Most patients say that the tummy tuck and breast augmentation hurt less than a c section.</p><p>Don’t stress about it. Get a good night’s sleep and you will be fine! (W. John Bull, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
