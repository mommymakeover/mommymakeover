It is certainly possible to perform them all together in one setting and I would say this is the norm rather than the exception.</p><p>However, there are always extenuating circumstances that may dictate doing one or more at a separate time. This is really a question that is best answered at the time of a consultation with a physician who has experience doing these multiple procedure cases.</p><p>I would reccommend you do some homework and find a surgeon you feel comfortable with and let them guide you.</p><h3>Mommy does not have time for 3 surgeries & recoveries</h3><p>Most surgeons refer to a “mommy makeover in Oklahoma City” as a series of cosmetic surgery procedures intended to restore a woman’s figure after pregnancy.</p><p>I perform these procedures as part of a “mommy makeover” for patients who want an improved figure after having children. Pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding can take a serious toll on a woman’s body, and many moms find that no amount of diet and exercise can restore their pre-baby figures.</p><p></p>

</div>It is very common for me to perform procedures on the breast as well as the tummy in one setting – hence one procedure – one recovery.
<p>Procedures commonly performed during mommy makeovers include:</p><ol>
<li>Abominoplasty (tummy tuck)</li>
<li>Breast Augmentation +/- Lift, or</li>
<li>Breast Lift only without implants, liposuction</li>
</ol><p>These procedures can be performed in one stage or multiple stages depending on the patient’s goals, health status and other screening criteria.</p><p>After pregnancy, breasts can lose their youthful position and shape, the tummy can become stretched and lose its tone, and extra fat may get deposited in areas that are not so flattering.</p><p></p>

</div>The plastic surgery procedures above are intended to correct those conditions and help restore your pre-pregnancy figure. Please visit with a ASPS member surgeon to review your options.
<h3>What is the Best Way to Prepare for a Mommy Makeover?</h3><p>To ask than follow your chosen surgeon pre operative instructions. Stop all aspirin products, all vitamins, smoking is the usual precautions.</p><p>But each surgeon has their own set of requirements = “informed consent”.</p><h4>Preparation for mommy makeover in OKC</h4><p>Patients preparing for a mommy makeover should arrange to have help after their surgery, especially if they have small children. </p><p></p>

</div>Usually two weeks of extra assistance is greatly appreciated. Husbands are also often required to chip in extra mommy duties during the recovery period.
<p>Doing too much too soon can derail a successful surgery, cause recurrence of any repaired belly button hernias, or just make recovery difficult. As with any surgery, careful follow-up with the surgeon is valuable.</p><p>There are wound treatments and laser treatments that may be helpful to the patient as well. Patients should be in as good a physical condition as possible. Your doctor can advise you on supplements, which medications to stop, etc. (Brent Moelleken, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mommy Makeover Recovery Period</h3><p></p>

</div>I typically advise my OKC Mommy Makeover patients to avoid any heavy lifting, going to gym, or heavy exercise for 6 weeks after surgery. 
<p>Most people who work a desk job will back at their desk in about a week plus a weekend on either end of that time.</p><p>If your job involves heavy lifting or strenuous activity which would raise your blood pressure, you will need to make appropriate adjustments in your activity and work level in order to allow yourself the appropriate healing for your best possible result. Be sure and consult with your board-certified plastic surgeon.</p><p><strong>Weight gain after Abdominoplasty or Tummy Tuck</strong></p><p></p>

</div>It is normal to gain weight after mommy lift. This happens for a number of reasons. First, your body secretes a hormone call anti diuretic hormone that causes you to retain water. Also the surgical trauma will cause additional swelling.
<p>Your implants will add 2.2 pounds to your weight. (1000 ccs equals 2.2 pounds) As you continue to heal and progress through recovery you will lose additional weight.</p><p>I believe your weight gain is normal especially since you are only 2 weeks out from mom lift. The weight will continue to change, and normalize over the next few months.</p><h3>Mommy Makeover financing</h3><p><strong>OKC mommy makeover</strong> can be expensive. Some patients pay cash up front or use a credit card. The credit card option allows you the flexibility to pay over time and pay off the balance if you are able to without additional fees.<br>

</div>One restriction may be your credit card limit. For those who don’t have one or do not want to use their credit card or those that need additional financing options, many practices offer a financing option through a third party such as Care Credit or Chase. 
<p>You can apply online (even while in the surgeon’s office) and receive an answer regarding qualification immediately.</p><p>The company then pays the surgeon for your procedure and you can make monthly payments in accordance with your agreement. Most practices require payment prior to the procedure so many patients take advantage of these options.</p><p></p>

</ul><p>The cost of a Mommy Makeover in OKC depends upon what operation is done. The traditional mommy makeover is a full tummy tuck and a breast lift with or without augmentation. It has its own name because it treats the areas the are most dramatically changed with pregnancy, childbirth and nursing.</p><p>Many women have a hard time with how their bodies change with childbirth. Fit, thin, healthy people all of the sudden have a muffin top and deflated breasts. What bothers you and what you desire very much determines what we do and, therefore, the cost. A modern approach to plastic surgery features multiple options for each of the different procedures.</p><p>As a result, the costs even for a specific procedure can vary. A breast lift can take 30 minutes or 2 hours depending upon what is needed to get you where you want to be. The same is true for a tummy tuck. In short, the cost is dependant upon both what you need to look your best and what matters the most to you.</p><p>Both of those things are critically important. If you are considering a mommy makeover in Oklahoma City shop around as much to find a doctor you like and trust as to find a cost.</p><p>Changes with a Mommy Makeover in Oklahoma City are permanent and you want your best possible outcome. (Jeremy Pyle, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Oklahoma City Mommy makeover prices may vary depending on the procedures performed and how long the surgery takes. Currently in my practice I have a mommy makeover special all inclusive for $9999 which includes a breast augmentation with silicone implants, a full tummy tuck with liposuction of the waist; a breast lift is additional if needed. (Melinda Lirag Lacerna-Kimbrell, MD, FACS, Sarasota Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Oklahoma City Mommy Makeover Cost</h3><p>The cost for a Mommy Makeover will vary depending on the combination of procedures required to give you the results you desire. The Mommy Makeover is a combination of Breast Surgery (either Augmentation or Breast Lift) and body contouring (tummy tuck, mini tummy tuck or liposuction). The breast lift can vary in price from 8900.00-10900.00 depending on the use of implants and which type (saline or silicone). The other component of the surgery will determine to rest of the price. Liposuction would be the least expensive of the three options with tummy tuck being the more expensive.Generally, a mommy makeover in my practice runs 10,000.00 – 15,000.00. But it is impossible to quote a price without examining the patient. Consult your surgeon and allow him to advise you and guide you in determining which options are best for you. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Oklahoma City Mommy makeover costs vary since each patient is different</h3><p>Some moms need tummy work, some need breast surgery, others need body contouring. some need combinations of several procedures. you would need to see a board certified plastic surgeon and decide on a surgical plan before a cost estimate could be given. (Bruce K. Barach, MD, Schenectady Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Price for Mommy Makeover</h3><p>Although price is a consideration in all of our decisions. Don’t let be the only determining factor when it comes to quality plastic surgery. Call the offices of board-certified plastic surgeons and get a feel for the costs of your particular surgery in your area. Then visit with a few of them for consultation. This way you can make a decision on your surgeon based on your confidence in their ability to deliver the results that you desire within the constraints of your budget. (Dustin L. Reid, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Mommy Makeover</h3><p>This depends on who and where, and how much is going to be corrected. Some call a skin removal a tummy tuck, and do no tightening of the abdominal muscle, even if indicated, or do no liposuction to feather the corners of the tummy tuck, and they too call this a tummy tuck. Thus, there are many different variations on the theme, and you must find out what is going to be done, and what you need or want. If you muscle is fine, and there is no lateral fat, then all you may need is just some skin removed. Have an assessment with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon, and they will inform you of what you need and you can decide if that is right for you, and aligned with your goals and expectations. All I can say is that we do a lot of tummy tuck revisions because people still want the abdomen bulge gone because their muscle was not repaired, and they want lipo of the lateral abdominal fat because they were not told they could have that area treated with liposuction. They got a great deal though, just an incomplete surgery. A cheap price is 5k-7.5k (this is the common price we see where more work is needed). Typical is 10-17K depending on the muscle repair needed, and liposuction needed. (Vivek Bansal, MD, Danville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mini Tummy Tuck, Breast Augmentation, and Liposuction in One Surgery</h3><p>Depending on the amount of loose skin and fat to be removed, it is possible to combine the three procedures in a mommy makeover on the same surgery day.</p><p>You will need to balance the benefits of combining versus the possible better results in performing the surgeries in stages.</p><p>Surgical fees will vary depending on location and scope of work.</p><p>However, the combination will most likely be between $8500 to $15000. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Multiple procedures in one surgery</h3><p>You mentioned a breast augmentation, mini tummy tuck, and liposuction, but you also mentioned sagging breasts and a loose tummy.</p><p></p>

</div>Breast implants alone will not lift your breasts. All they are designed to do is to add volume to the breast. If your breasts are sagging then you might need a breast lift more than a breast augmentation.
<p>A breast lift can be done with or without the addition of breast implants. Mini tummy tucks are good for tightening muscles and removing a VERY small amount of skin below the belly button, but they are fairly limited in what they can accomplish.</p><p>If you have a lot of loose skin then a full tummy tuck may be a better option. The trade-off is a longer scar, however, the longer the scar, the more loose skin can be removed. If you have fat in the thighs then liposuction may be a good choice to correct this problem.</p><p>As for the costs, different doctors have different fees. There is no standard fee for this type of surgery. That is something you will have to discuss with the doctor who performs your surgery. (Edwin C. Pound, III, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combining surgeries, is it too much?</h3><p>If you are healthy, without any significant medical conditions and working with an experienced board certified plastic surgeon, then performing all three procedure at once is certainly reasonable. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combining multiple surgeries at once. – Is it too much?</h3><p>Thank you for your question. The surgeries that you have listed are commonly performed together. There is certainly such a thing as too much surgery but this grouping is actually quite common.</p><p>If you’re choosing too many procedures it wants your plastic surgeon should certainly let you know. Before embarking upon this group or any other surgeries your surgeon must be certain that you’re healthy enough to be a good candidate. It is likely that your surgeon will want some blood tests to help confirm your health. Obviously you should be as healthy as you can as well.</p><p>Being at a good weight will be safer and give you a better cosmetic outcome. If you’re a smoker, and I hope you’re not, you should stop smoking at least three weeks prior to your surgery if not more. The cost of each of these procedures varies widely across the country. It will really depend upon your geographic area. You should be certain that your surgeon, or the surgeons that you are entertaining give you quotations ahead of time so that you don’t have any financial surprises. (Adam Tattelbaum, MD, Washington DC Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>It is possible to have more than one procedure done at the same time</h3><p>It is possible to have more than one procedure done at the same time, depending on what procedures you want.</p><p>Especially if you are in good health, the three procedures you are considering, mini-tummy tuck, breast augmentation, and liposuction, can be done at the same time.</p><p>I would recommend consulting a plastic surgeon in your area who is board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. (James Tang, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tummy tuck combinations</h3><p>This combination is frequently performed in my practice. I would encourage you to discuss this with your surgeon, but it is certainly possible, provided the operative time is no more than six hours, if you are planning on doing this as an outpatient. If more time is required for the surgery you can certainly have this performed but may need to be admitted to the hospital. (Francis (Frank) William Rieger, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Product" class="amp-wp-inline-0f1bf07c72fdf1784fff2e164d9dca98">
