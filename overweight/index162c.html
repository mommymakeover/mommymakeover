The main thing is to be at a stable weight that you are happy with. An abdominoplasty allows the surgeon to remove skin and tighten the abdominal wall.</p><p>If you were to lose a significant amount of weight after a tummy tuck, you may be left with excess skin and a tummy that is not as tight as you would like.</p><p>Being at your goal weight will allow you to have a result after surgery that you can anticipate and should be long-lasting if you maintain your goal weight. (Austin Hayes, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no ideal weight for a mommy make over. It is more important that a woman’s overweight is stable and that she is not actively losing weight at the time of the surgery.</p><p>Once the weight is at a plateau, a mommy make over can be done.</p><p>The best results from a mommy make over are in a woman who is near her target weight. While this often differs from a listed ideal body weight, it can be a more realistic goal that is attainable and maintainable.</p><p>If weight is lost after the mommy make over, your skin may become more lax and hinder your final result.</p><p>I would suggest that you get to a stable weight that you are comfortable with prior to surgery.</p><p>Do not try to retain extra fat just for the liposuction. Once your weight is stable for 3 months or so, it would be optimal to proceed with the surgery. Also, remember that weight is just a number, and that it is the appearance of your body and its curves that are more important. (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>There is no ideal weight for having these procedures performed however being significantly overweight will increase the chances of having problems with healing and other complications. Ideally if you have plateaued in weight loss then that is the time to proceed. Sometimes the surgery will spur you forward to even more weight loss and exercise (Norman Bakshandeh, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)
<p>It is best for you to be as close as possible to your ideal weight before having a mommy makeover. If you are unable to achieve that weight, you may still be a good candidate for surgery.</p><p>The best result, however, will be when you also help yourself by losing more weight. (David Stoker, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I always like my patients to reach their best possible weight prior to abdominoplasty or mommy makeover surgery. There is no hurry to have elective surgery!</p><p></p>

</div>Weight loss prior to the mommy makeover allows your surgeon to achieve a tighter abdomen and the patient can select a more proportionate breast implant size. From a medical standpoint, the lower surgical weight also reduces the rate of complications.
<p>I operate on patients who are loosing weight when they plateau for 4-6 weeks and are happy that their weight loss goal has been reached. Operating before the weight loss can also result in loose abdominal skin and a less enviable outcome (with further weight loss). (Douglas J. Raskin, MD, Colorado Springs Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no “perfect” weight to do the surgery. It is best to get down to the weight you want to be before having surgery.This will give you the best and longest lasting result. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my practice, I advise patients not to attain a desired weight, but to have a stable weight prior to the surgery. You are a candidate if you have maintained your overweight. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>There is no ideal weight. If your body mass index is &gt; 30 the risk of complications from body contouring surgery may be elevated. My recommendation is to get to the weight you want and get your mommy makeover once you’ve reached that goal. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>Mommy Makeover best if weight is stable</strong><br>
A mommy makeover can be performed on any person at any weight, however, you will get the best possible result if your overweight is stable, usually for 6 months. </p><p>Of course, you would like to be at your “ideal body weight”, but that is easier said than done. </p><p>Many women are very motivated after they receive their new body and go on to lose more weight after their procedure. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>I always recommend that my patients are as close to their goal weight as possible before having surgery so they get the best results. I would need to examine you in person to tell you how much weight you should lose before having a tummy tuck and liposuction to get the best results.
<p>But I do recommend you go ahead and consult with a board certified plastic surgeon now so that you can plan ahead for your Mommy Makeover. Determining how much weight to lose now will help you set a plan of action so you are ready and motivated for your Mommy Makeover! (Jimmy S.

</div>There is no ideal weight for a mommy makeover. A patient should be stable in their weight and close to an ideal body weight for their height. When one approaches 10+ pounds of their IBW then they can proceed with the surgery. A lower weight will help with healing. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Your candidacy for a cosmetic surgical procedure (including a mommy makeover) with regards to weight actually has to do more with your BMI than just the number on the scale. If you are actively loosing weight or planning on loosing a significant amount of weight, I would recommend waiting until your weight has stabilized before undergoing a mommy makeover. With that said, please schedule a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon who is well experienced in body contouring and mommy makeover procedures. The best advice will come after an in-person physical exam and thorough discussion of your concerns and cosmetic surgery goals. (Stephen T. Greenberg, MD, Woodbury Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Losing weight and mommy makeover</h5><p></p>

</div>I would recommend you loses weight and have your weight stabilized before you consider a mommy makeover. Its not mandatory but you will get your best result if you stabilize your weight. I have had some patients have the excess fat removed to jump start their weight loss as well. Those pt realize that they will likely need a second procedure after their weight stabilizes (depending on how much weight they lose. (Raj S. Ambay, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>Attain a stable, healthy, sustainable weight prior to Mommy Makeover</strong><br>
You are on the right track by engaging in diet and exercise to attain your ideal weight prior to surgery. But it will be important to continue your maintenance regimen afterward as well. So the best weight for you will be that which is stable, healthy, and sustainable for you over the long term. </p><p>Generally, it is better to avoid additional weight loss after your surgery, rather than keep an extra 20 lbs for the sole purpose of removing more fat by liposuction. (Peter Bray, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>Normally, it is best to get within approximately ten pounds of your ideal body weight before you perform this type of surgery. 
<p>Any operation that tightens the skin will have a better outcome if you are close to your ideal body weight. If a person underwent a tummy tuck and then lost 40 pounds, there would likely be loose skin resulting that would not be there if the tummy tuck was done after weight loss was accomplished. The same is true for any type of breast surgery. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The closer you are to your ideal body weight; the better the result you will have with your surgery. You do not need more fat for better liposuction result. </p><p>The higher the BMI; the higher the complication rate with surgery. So continue your present regimen and enhance your outcome.  (Donald Nunn, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>Typically after any major body change such as pregnancy, major weight loss or previous surgery, I will advise the patients to wait a minimum of 4 months to allow the body to stabilize. Many surgeons advocate 6 months for a stable body weight. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)

I thing it is best to get to a stable weight first. What that will be depends on many factors. It may not be your pre-pregnancy overweight. It is also good to establish your exercise and eating habits prior to surgery. </p><p>Sometimes that means waiting until your child is a bit older as the stress/time needed caring for younger children may make it difficult to lose weight. (Michael Philbin, MD, Edina Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>The ideal weight to proceed with a mommy makeover will need to fit your lifestyle. Some patients want to get down to their ideal weight before scheduling the nips and tucks, but I also have patients that will strategically have their surgery first, then use the results to encourage momentum in their quest to lose even more weight. It is best to discuss the pros and cons of both strategies with your surgeon and determine if your decision can be supported by your family, work, and lifestyle. (Randy Wong, MD, Honolulu Plastic Surgeon)
<p>With body surgery weight gain or loss beyond a few pounds after the surgery tends to change the result. These changes can lead to a desire to have more surgery, I tell my patients to try to be realistic regarding the weight they feel they can maintain and try to get close before surgery to help minimize these redos. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>To make it a safer procedure for you, I’d recommend you be close to your ideal weight and be stable. That way you can have longer lasting results because they won’t be affected by future weight fluctuations. (Michael Constantin Gartner, DO, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Personally I can get an idea about a patient by actually looking at them in person. Some surgeons will just not operate based on a BMI index which is higher than a certain limit. Losing weight can be difficult but some patients who are quite heavy it is really the best and most healthy thing for them to do before a surgery such as a tummy tuck. The most important thing is to be the healthiest for your operation before you have it done. (Kimberly A. Henry, MD, Greenbrae Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Mommy makeover and weight loss </strong><br>
It sounds like it would be ideal for you to lies some weight before the mommy makeover, but get down to 120 could be quite difficult. Equally as important, though, is to make sure you don’t gain weight after the surgery. It’s easy to do if you don’t weight yourself daily. (Ronald J. Edelson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>you will get the best results once you are close to your ideal / goal weight. once your weight loss has stabilized, schedule a consult with a board certified PS (Sugene Kim, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Before any elective surgery such as a Mommy Makeover, you should get into the best physical shape possible! This includes a healthy, balanced diet, regular exercise, psychological wellness, and achieving as close to your ideal weight as possible. Before I agree to operate on a Mom, we need to reach a level of trust and she needs to show she is as committed to the transformation as I am.</p><p>As a surgeon, I take on an enormous degree of responsibility to do the very best job possible, care for my patients and ensure they are safe, happy and healthy, with a beautiful result of their Mommy Makeover.</p><p>As a patient, you should also commit to the process by getting your body as physically ready for surgery by considering all of the points above. The number on the scale is less important than being fit, reducing your body fat percentage, and ensuring you are a safe candidate for surgery. Your post-partum weight may not be exactly the same as your pre-pregnancy weight. Visit your Family Doctor for additional guidance on a healthy body weight, and what is realistic for you. (Karen M. Horton, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Optimal results from a mommy makeover are usually achieved if the patient is at or near their ideal weight. Liposuction is indicated to correct fat deposits in areas that are resistant to diet and exercise, and keeping overweight on does not yield better results from liposuction. (Olivia Hutchinson, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
