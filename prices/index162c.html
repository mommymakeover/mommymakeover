<strong>Abdominoplasty</strong> is a plastic surgery aimed at lifting the hanging belly and relaxed abdominal muscles. The sick theme of most young mothers is the stomach. After the birth of one, two, or three babies a woman discovers that she can not bring her stomach in an elegant state by any physical exercise.It is also important here to note that carrying out this operation is premature in some cases. In particular, if a woman is planning another pregnancy or is going to drastically lose weight after the operation. In this case, it is better to carry out the operation after the implementation of these plans. The combination of abdominoplasty with liposuction makes it possible to achieve the optimum effect.</li>
<li>
<strong>Liposuction</strong> is a procedure for pumping out fat in places of excess of subcutaneous fat. Usually this procedure is carried out not separately, but in combination with other methods of plastic surgery.</li>
<li>
<strong>Breast augmentation and mastopexy</strong> is an operation to lift the breasts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cervicoplasty, platysmoplasty</strong> is an operation to lift the neck.</li>

</div><p>Currently, more and more popular in the US are complex plastic surgeries after childbirth (mommy makeover). The benefit of complex shape transformation after delivery is obvious and consists in the fact that:</p><ol>
<li>A woman can change not one detail of her figure in one operation, but several, for example, enlarge and lift the breasts, make the tummy more flat, tummy tuck with liposuction, make vaginal plastic and tummy tuck or breast lift, etc.</li>
<li>The risk of postoperative complications is significantly reduced, as only one operation and one anesthesia are done, instead of two or three operations and, accordingly, anesthesias.</li>
<li>This is more profitable in financial terms, since the operation âtwo in oneâ is cheaper than two separate operations.</li>

<li>You carry only one recovery period. That is, the recovery period after such a complex operation can be a little longer, but by comparing several separate operations and their recovery periods, the complex operation looks much more attractive.</li>
<li>Another plus of complex plastic surgery is your activity. You just need to break away from your family and work just once. If you would choose two or three operations separately, you would have to go to the clinic several times, with all the ensuing inconveniences.</li>

</div><p>Complex operations are much more effective in terms of the end result than one operation. Surely, after the birth, there were changes not only in the abdomen, but also in the chest, neck, face, and vagina, which is also very important.</p><p>After removing one problem, for example, after a tummy tuck, you do not get rid of others (for example, hanging breasts), which undoubtedly affects the result of the operation. At the same time, as a result of the mommy makeover surgery, there will be a completely transformed woman. Even difficult to say that she gave birth.</p><p>This factor is also important. Of course, one complex operation is more expensive than one simple operation. But if we compare the complex of tummy tuck and breast lift and both these procedures performed in the course of individual operations, it turns out that the former is much cheaper, because it is possible to obtain a substantial discount for conducting double operations.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1718" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a86fe13a97262f852bdd92c8b935f613">

</div><p>The official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons told about modern possibilities of mommy makeover. Correction of body contouring includes tummy tuck (abdominoplasty), breast lift (mastopexy), and procedures to address problems in areas of the body that are affected by pregnancy (usually the pelvis, back, thighs, hips or feet).</p><p>With progress in the areas of surgical techniques and patient care, it has become possible to safely and efficiently combine several procedures into one and thereby restore the form immediately in several areas with less visible scars, minimal discomfort and the shortest recovery period.</p><p>Researchers of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons associate the growing interest of the operation with the increase in the number of pregnancies at a late age and multiple births, as well as a fashion for proper nutrition, fitness and smart appearance. In most cases, as a sample of the desired result, the patient brings her photos before pregnancy.</p><p>Members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons encourage colleagues to pay special attention to the psychological condition of patients, especially in the early postpartum period.</p><h3>Mommy Makeover Typically Ranges Between $10,000 and $15,000</h3><p>The cost of mommy makeover surgery varies significantly and is dependent upon a multitude of variables. Itâs important to understand these variables and how they contribute to any fee quote you may receive.</p><p>For instance, does the fee quote include the surgeonâs fee, facility fee, anesthesia charges, and breast implant charges, or just the surgeonâs fee? Itâs also important to understand the surgeonâs revisional surgery policy.</p><p>In other words, if additional surgery is necessary, who pays for it? The mommy makeover is a highly individualized surgical procedure that addresses the anatomic changes that follow pregnancy. The procedure addresses changes in the breasts, abdomen, and areas of fat accumulation in the hips and thighs. Most women need abdominoplasty and liposuction of the hips and thighs.</p><p>The breasts may require reduction, augmentation, lift, or augmentation in combination with lift. There are multiple fee quote possibilities, depending upon the patientâs needs and itâs important to remember that multiple procedure discounts are available.</p><p>The fees for a mommy makeover with anesthesia and facility fees included typically range between $10,000 and $15,000, depending upon the exact combination chosen. Itâs very important that patients have a thorough understanding of these issues.</p><p>Be careful of cost quotes. There is a wide variety of what can be considered a âMommy Makeoverâ. In general women consider a mommy makeover to include a tummy tuck and breast surgery.</p><p>But does that include a breast lift, implants, reduction? Does their tummy need additional liposuction around the waist and back, or would they do best with a circumferential tummy tuck.</p><p>Also the total âcostâ will include the surgeonâs fee, as well as charges for anesthesia and the facility (operating room costs). Honestly the total fee can range anywhere between $9000 to 15000 for everything. Thatâs a big range! Pick your surgeon for quality and communication first.</p><p>Price can certainly matter but donât compromise your results for a âdealâ. You get what you pay for and anyone offering you cut rate prices is probably cutting corners.</p><p>The cost of a mommy makeover can vary dramatically depending on what is done. Typically when I talk about mommy makeover surgery, I am talking about abominal surgery such as a tummy tuck in combination with breast surgery such as a breast augmentation or lift.</p><p>Liposuction is also frequently performed, and I also specialize in labiaplasty and vaginoplasty which can be performed simultaneously. A typical tummy tuck with side liposuction and breast augmentation can be done as an outpatient and costs around $12000 (this includes the surgeon, anesthesia and facility fee).</p><p>This is a very rough estimate, however,because every patient is slightly different. Although costs can vary across geographical regions, in general a Mommy Makeover range is $11,000 to about $18,000.</p><p>Cost usually include; doctors fee, implants (if needed) hospital or operating room fee and anesthesia fee and all your follow up appointments. It depends on what type of tummy tuck and lift required to achieve a natural balanced form. In some cases liposuction is added to sculpted the abdomen and soften the final look. There are many combinations of procedures that are used in the mommy make over. These procedures will vary incomplexity and therefore in price. The average price ranges from $13,500-$15,000.</p><p>There are a number of procedures which may be performed as part of a âmommy makeoverâ, including breast augmentation, breast lift, tummy tuck and liposuction. The price will depend on which combination of procedures you choose, fees for your surgeon and facility, and will usually run in the thousands of dollars.</p><p>The fees really depend upon what you need to have done and where you have it done. Are you having a breast augmentation or a lift, liposuction, minim-tummy tuck, or full tummy tuck?</p><p>The price of the mommy makeover depends entirely on the combination of procedures you choose to receive. Some women only need liposuction other abdomen; other women need a full tummy tuck. Some women just need a breast augmentation or breast lift, whereas other women may require both at the same time. The exact combination of a mommy makeover and the amount of time it will take to perform this procedure will be the ultimate determinants of the price.</p><p>This really depends on what you want to improve. For example we can improve the facial skin and pregnancy maskâ of pigmentation with chemical peels for as low as several hundred dollars a treatment.</p><p>More involved surgical procedures like breast implants or tummy tuck cost about $5000 to $6000 dollar range in my practice. One of our new procedures the Vaser shape is a non invasive tool to reduce fat and cellulite as well as tighten skin. A series of 4 treatments is about $3000.</p><p>The key is to meet with a doctor you trust and review what you want to improve. Do not be sold on just price alone. please seek a board certified plastic surgeon for consultation. The cost of the mommy makeover has several components. The anesthesia and operating room fees are dependent on the amount of time in the operating room, which is dependent on the complexity of the surgery.</p><p>Typical time in the OR is 4 to 5 hours, so the fee is approximately $4000. The professional fee is for the surgeon to perform the tummy tuck and whatever is needed for the breasts.</p><p>The tummy tuck part of the mommy makeover is pretty standard ( about 3 hours). The breast procedure usually involves an implant (silicon or saline) and possibly a lift.</p><p>Therefore the fee can vary significantly depending on the exact procedure on the breast. The range of surgeons fee is $10-15,000.</p><p>Since the mommy makeover is not just one operation, the cost depends on what you need to have done. A tummy tuck plus or minus some flank liposuction is a common element and breast augmentation plus minus lifting is also quite commonly needed to complete the process.</p><p>Costs range from $ 6,000 to $20,000 or so but can vary regionally and with the surgeon. Just make sure you go to a real Board Certified plastic surgeon and that they are the best in your area. It is much more expensive to try to fix bad surgery (and often canât be done) than to get it right in the first place!</p><p>The price of a Mommy Makeover depends upon what is actually needed, but may range from approximately $6000-$20000.</p><p>These costs are all-inclusive (surgeon fee, implant fee, and facility fee) as done as an outpatient with twilight anesthesia in our accredited surgical suite.</p><p>A Mommy Makeover usually addresses concerns with the breasts, excess fat, and the tummy and may include a combination of breast augmentation/lift/reduction, tummy tuck, and liposuction.</p><p>Your surgeon can give you an exact cost after examining you and discussing your concerns.</p><h3>Plastic Surgery Mommy Makeover Prices</h3></div></div></article>
