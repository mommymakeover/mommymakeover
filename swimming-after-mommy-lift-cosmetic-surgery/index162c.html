The procedure combines cosmetic breast surgery, liposuction, and abdominoplasty. </p><p>Patients are eager to return to normal activity as soon as possible following a Mommy Make-Over. Unfortunately, returning to normal activity too soon can potentially result in an increased potential for complications. </p><p>Swimming and similar activities if resumed too soon following a Mommy Make-Over can potentially result in an increased complication rate. </p><p>Although it may be possible to get into the water four weeks following this procedure, strenuous activities like swimming would be out of the question. </p><p>Theoretically, once the skin edges have sealed in about 48 hours following surgery, these activities can be resumed. In reality, many patients have drains in place for three weeks or longer after this procedure. In addition, small absorbable interrupted sutures may break through the skin and become exposed. </p><p>In this situation, infection could occur in a patient who is submerged in a pool, pond, or the ocean. </p><p>Each of these environments may have unique and in many cases antibiotic resistant bacteria that could lead to a significant infection. In addition, we generally don’t recommend resumption of strenuous activities for at least six weeks following abdominoplasty. </p><p></p>

</div>Swimming can create significant strain on the core muscles of the abdomen, and should therefore be avoided in the immediate post-operative period. Finally, the abdomen and breasts may not have normal sensation immediately after surgery. 
<p>This potentially can result in severe sunburn if proper care is not taken. It’s important to remember that every patient’s procedure and post-operative course is unique. For these reasons, make sure you consult your plastic surgeon before getting into the water. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>After mommy makeover we routinely recommend that a patient quickly return to the gentle aerobic exercise such as walking. </p><p></p>

</div>For more aggressive exercise such as running, swimming, or lifting weights, we ask our patients to do this at least six weeks after their surgery. This makes sure that their healing process has advanced to a stage where these activities may not injure their results (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)
<p>A Mommy Makeover is a combination of procedures to address post-pregnancy issues of the breasts, fat excess, and the tummy. Your recovery will depend upon many things, including what you actually have done. </p><p>At four weeks, assuming all your incisions are healed, you should be able to get into the water. However, you probably will not be able to do much swimming, as lack of stamina and tight skin and muscles may limit your activity. If you have any issues with healing, then getting into ocean water will not be good. Either way, you should be able to enjoy your vacation! (Randy J. Buckspan, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you are completely healed and not having any wound issues, you probably can do light swimming at 4 weeks. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Swimming after a Mommy Makeover</h5><p></p>

</div>Assuming you don’t have any wound-healing complications, you should be able to swim 4 weeks after your surgery. I’m also assuming you’re not planning a strenuous swim race or anything like that–I’m assuming you want to float around the pool or stand in the ocean a paddle a bit. If you want to do anything more strenuous, I would wait the full 6 weeks after surgery. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Yes, barring wound complications, you should be able to go in the water and swim a month after mommy makeover surgery. However, your scars may become irritated or even sun burned leading to a prolongation of the period for scar maturity. </p><p>So Ideally, you should protect your scars from the sun. Additionally, you should avoid activities that may stress the operative site. For example, playing golf or tennis requires that you tighten your abdominal muscles forcefully. Optimally I prefer that the patients wait for 6 to 8 weeks before beginning to start these types of activities, and longer if they do more strenuous activity such as rock climbing. (Fredrick A. Valauri, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Swimming following mommy makeover</h4><p>You should certainly be able to enjoy some time in the water four weeks following mommy makeover. You may still want to limit strenuous activity until around six weeks following surgery. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Can I Swim 4 Weeks After a Mommy Makeover?</h3><p>In general recovery from surgery takes six weeks. If you are healing well and have not had any complications you should be able to do a little swimming at four weeks after your surgery, but this has to be individualized for each patient. You will certainly not have all of your stamina back at four weeks and you should therefore keep this in mind for safety. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>Most likely you will be fine to swim or get in the water one month after surgery. Monitor your surgical sites and report any concerns to your surgeon. (Garrett A. Wirth, MD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)
<p><i>Swimming after a tummy tuck procedure</i></p><p>Depending on the severity and complexity of the case, patient’s incisions are healed by 4 weeks post-op tummy tuck surgery and they are able to stand straight. </p><p>You are required to stay hunched over for atleast 4 weeks to prevent any superficial openings. As long as their are no complications during the healing process, you may be able to get in the water. Strenuous activity is recommended after at least 6-8 weeks of healing. </p><p>The only set back i could imagine, is soaking the incision for long periods could cause the incisions to thicken which causes the scar to heal thicker than a nice fine line. Consult with your plastic surgeon before your trip to make sure. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I allow my patients to undergo any type of sports activity, swimming included, three weeks after almost any surgical prpocedure. At that point, exercise is healthy and the risko f a complication is close to zero. (Howard T. Bellin, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mommy makeover and activity</h3><p>The surgical extent and tissue involved for a “mommy makeover” varies person to person. The incisions will be closed and the presence of water on them is not issue. The amount of abdominal muscle work required will be th limiting factor. Once necessary surgery is determined resuming activity can them be determined. (Rodger Wade Pielet, MD (in memoriam), Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Exercise after mommy make-over</h5><p></p>

</div>After major surgery you need time to heal. as for sternoous activity you can when your body can tolerate it and when GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT BY YOUR SURGEON. If you are in pain and you are in deep water, you may be in trouble. (Samir Shureih, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Regarding swimming after a mommy make-over. If all your incisions are well healed, you should be able to go swimming. If you are uncomfortable or experience pain, then wait two weeks. Let your comfort level be your guide. (Fred Suess, MD (retired), San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This is a question ONLY for your surgeon. What I recommend means nothing since I’m not your operating surgeon. Please ALWAYS follow the advise of the operating surgeon. As for me 4 weeks is OK but be careful. (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>Depending on what is being done in your mommy makeover, it might be possible to swim at one month. If there is a tummy tuck involved though, this is cutting it very close. 6 weeks would have been better. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)
<p><em>Recovery time after mommy makeover before swimming</em></p><p>The mommy makeover typically includes a tummy tuck and breast surgery, and the tummy tuck usually invloves some suturing to the muscle layer which is very similar to a hernia repair. We usually recommend 6 weeks before strenuous activity or lifting, but if everything goes well you should be able to get in a pool without being too active. A related issue is the travel, which might be more of a concern. If you had any way to move the surgery 2 weeks earlier, you might be better off.
