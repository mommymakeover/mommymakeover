So liposuction, tummy tuck, breast implants, breast lift or breast reduction, may be included. I include hernia repairs at the same time as a tummy tuck. Since there is so much variability, the cost depends on which procedures are done.</p><p><em>Selecting your surgeon</em><br>
You need a plastic surgeon with Board Certification from the American Board of Plastic Surgery who has hospital admitting privileges and who will do your surgery in an accredited surgery center. Go overseas at your risk – it does not make sense to me to travel a long distance to have surgery with a surgeon you have not met in a country that you do not know. Always see a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. There are many pages on the internet with all the info you need about the doctors and reviews from there clients.</p><p>First of all, make sure that the surgeon you choose is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. Did both of your surgeons spend a lot of time with you and answer all of your questions</p><p>If you can’t decide, I would choose the one who has the best before and after photos for the procedures that you are going to have. If you are choosing between two well qualified surgeons – that’s great! There’s an abundance of talent in your area! Here are some other ideas to help you with your choice: Look at their before and after photos. Ask about how they handle complications. Speak to other patients from their practice. Which practice gives you “the warm fuzzies”? Which one has done more of your procedures?</p><p><strong>Choosing surgeons</strong></p><p>If all things are truly equal and you feel confident with both, it probably doesn’t matter in that you will not know if you made the right or wrong choice until you do the surgery</p><p></p>

</div>That is, if everything goes well, you will say you made the right choice. If something goes wrong, you will say you made the wrong choice. My advice to patients is that if everything goes well, it doesn’t matter. Everyone expects that. 
<p>However, things can go wrong no matter who is operating on you. Ask yourself, which doctor will be more likely to be able to treat you appropriately if things do not go according to plan</p><p>The doctor that you can be direct with in communication, the one that has experience with treating complications, the one that is referred to by other doctors, may be the one you want to choose</p><p>If both plastic surgeons are board certified by the american board of plastic surgery and members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons and you had positive experiences in with both offices, its a tough call</p><p></p>

</div>Look at each practice’s before/after photos as well. Sounds like you’ve done your homework. Go with your gut feeling. I’m sure either board certified plastic surgeon will do a great job
<p>If you have met with two plastic surgeons and you like both, and both are also equally qualified in terms of board certification, then my advice would be to choose the one that is more experience in the surgery that you are interested in</p><p>If you make sure that the doctor is certified by the American board of Plastic Surgery. </p><p>That way you will know that they have had the proper training in performing this procedure</p><p><em>Staff and speaking with prior patients may help in your decision</em></p><p></p>

</div>The doctors staff can also play an important role in preparing for surgery as well as who will be assisting in your recovery process. I would recommend that you feel comfortable with everyone that will be involved in your care
<p>Also, you may consider seeking advise from prior patients of the surgeons. In my office we give a list of names and phone numbers of previous patients who are willing to speak with prospective patients about their experience</p><p>This may help you to make your final decision.</p><p>You can also find out what reputable hospitals they could perform this procedure in. If they can not do it there they should not be doing it any where. If you have already confirmed the above then sometimes asking friends or hospital employees will help</p><h3>How to choose a surgeon</h3><p></p>

</div>Do you have any friends who have had experiences at the different offices? That may be helpful. Do they both have photos of results to share with you? They are both Board Certified? The key is that you communicate well and that the surgeon is Board Certified and can show you representative results that you like
<p>Last but not least how do you feel about the doctor and his or her office? Have all of your questions been answered, have you looked at photos and are you comfortable with the doctor, staff and the office in general. The price will probably not be that different but you can take that in to consideration also. If you do this I am sure you will be very happy with your results.</p><p></p>

</div>I think the next step is for you to ask them how they perform the surgery, what they actually do and why they do what they do. Then think about their explanations and go with the one that makes the most logical sense to you
<p>Other factors that may help with your decision Board certification in plastic surgery – a MUST! Previous patient reviews (online review sites) “google” them Talk to previous patients Revision policy (who is financially responsible for revisions) Type of anesthesia used for the procedure of your choice</p><p>I prefer to avoid general anesthesia whenever possible for my patients Before and after photos. Quality and consistency. Make sure they are not misleading showing all views without cropping Previous legal actions taken Time spent with the physician and staff Likeability, honesty, and trust in the staff</p><p></p>

</div>I am sure that you have done all your homework, you’ve gotten to know the staff who will also be taking care of you, here are a few other thoughts call the local hospitals operating room and see who the staff their use, they see these doctors operating all the time, generally you’ll get someone who knows which plastic surgeon operates on the staff
<p>You could aslo ask about reputation at the hospital…a nice surgeon in the office but that is not well respected in the OR may not be the best choice Another suggestion is word of mouth<br>
who did your girlfriends use and why Ask your internist or OB/GYN… They more than likely have seen work from both surgeons. Ask who they would have operate on their mom or wife… with your search!</p><p><strong>Which plastic surgeon?</strong></p><p>As long as both plastic surgeons are board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, have extensive experience, operate in accredited facilities, and you are very comfortable with both, either one could be a good choice for you. Ask to see/talk to a few patients of each surgeon to compare results/care. Otherwise it is your decision upon whom you wish to chose.<br>

</div></center>
<br>
Given that you like both surgeons, the next step is to look at the surgeon’s staff, how easy is it to reach someone on the phone to answer questions and schedule an appointment
<p>Also, assess actually where the surgery is going to be done. Is it going to be at a hospital, ambulatory surgery facility, doctor’s office, etc… These things may help you decide. If after all your further evaluating, you still can’t decide, be glad that you have a win-win choice</p><p></p>

</div>You want to also be aware if the location where surgeries is performed is at an accredited facility. This is important for your safety.

This will assure you that he/she is board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.

You want a doctor that has been board certified specifically for plastic surgery.</p><p>In Canada certification is less an issue than the USA.

Make sure to ask! Some GPs still do cosmetic surgery but this is getting less common do to safety regulation changes a few years ago. They will have CCFP after their name. The next most important thing after identifying that your prospective surgeon is a plastic surgeon is to evaluate their reputation. This can be done by asking friends, your family doctor and looking at different review sites. Finally, go and meet them
<p>Make sure that they make you comfortable, that they take time to discuss your specific needs, that they will see you more than once rather than rushing you to pay and that they will consider your surgery and your result their highest priority.
