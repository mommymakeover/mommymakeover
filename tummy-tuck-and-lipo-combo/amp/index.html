Make sure family and friends are available to help with the care of children while you recover.</p><p>The more rest you get the faster you will heal and the better the results of the surgery. (Leila Kasrai, MD, FRCSC, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combination surgery including Mommy Makover</h3><p>As long as you are otherwise healthy you should be able to have that combination of procedures at one time. This might take 4-6 hours depending on how much liposuction you are talking about.</p><p>Many of our patients who have combination procedures will spend one night in our Plastic Surgery post op unit which they love and also speeds along their recovery (G. Wesley Price, MD, Chevy Chase Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combined procedures</h3><p>My patients are required to obtain medical clearance and basic blood work prior to surgery. We have a detailed discussion regarding the risks and benefits of multiple surgeries at once.</p><p>In general the combination you mention is safe to have at one time but each patient must be assessed individually meaning some will be able to have the surgery and others not.

Ferraro, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mini Tummy Tuck, Breast Augmentation, and Liposuction in One Surgery?</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_410" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The answer is yes! It seems like you have some knowledge about plastic surgery based on your question. I would caution about getting a mini-tummy tuck unless suggested by your plastic surgeon. Often a minimalist approach will yield minimal results.</p><p>If you are committing to the surgery and recovery time, make every effort to get the right combination of surgeries to maximize your chances of achieving your goals and desires. Consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon will help guide you through the process. (Jason Mussman, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mommy Makeover Combination Surgery</h3><p>This is a very common combination of surgeries that we perform together. Some have dubbed such combinations a “Mommy Makeover” in fact.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_412" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Finding the right surgeon that will take all of the necessary safety precautions to allow for a smooth operation and recovery is of the utmost importance with any surgery, but particularly so when multiple procedures are performed. (John K. Wakelin III, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tummy tuck combined with liposuction procedures are common and safe</h3><p>It is very common (and safe) to have this combination of procedures at the same time. Price varies – I would suggest consulting several board certified plastic surgeons to compare techniques, results, price, and your general level of comfort. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mommy makeover with liposuction of thighs</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_411" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-7af9f859e2e37e0c640b04017a5acf5e">

</div><p>You can easily have these three procedures done all at once. Essentially the procedure you describe is a Mommy Makeover with Thigh Liposuction. The price will vary depending on the individual components of your procedure.</p><p>A mommy makeover is breast surgery (either an augmentation or a lift) combined with body contouring (tummy tuck, mini tummy tuck or liposuction). The breast lift is the more expensive of the breast procedures and the tummy tuck would cost more than liposuction.</p><p>Depending upon your procedures, the price could range from 10,000-15,000.00. I would recommend making an appointment with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon who is a member of ASAPS (American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery) and who has perfumed hundreds of mommy makeovers. Discuss your options and make an informed decision. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mini Tummy Tuck, Breast Augmentation and Liposuction</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_414" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><p>Many women, particularly if they are fit and at a healthy and stable weight can be candidates for combing all these surgeries and having what is often referred to as a mommy makeover in a single surgery.</p><p>Even if you have one surgery, carefully evaluate each aspect of the surgery with any plastic surgeon you might consider. Start with belly buttons. Fake looking belly buttons and or scars around the belly buttons is not what women want after this procedure.</p><p>Look for natural looking results in both the abdomen area, with a smaller waist and a beautiful looking result both above and below the belly button. The same is true for breasts. A natural looking result from beast augmentation requiters an implant that is the ideal size and shape, and positioned appropriately on the chest wall. We all have seen breast implants of all sizes that look unnatural. Once you find a plastic surgeon who can demonstrate through many photographs that he or she can provide a look that is what you’d like, check their background. Look at where they trained and for how long.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_415" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-6aaa92a21cd6736f863e7ba688b56fd0">

</div><p>In addition to board certification membership with ASPS and ASAPS can indicate they have additional experience in aesthetic surgery. Check on the accreditation of the surgical facility they are using and ask who will be in the OR with you during surgery. If privacy is important, look for a plastic surgeon who treats high profile patients. Tis will mean that both the office and surgical suite will be on a first floor and will include a private entrance and exit so you do not need to show up for post operative appointments in a busy lobby or crowded elevator. The cost of a mommy makeover will depend upon the skill and expertise if the surgeon. It will also depend up what is included. All post -operative appointments, post-op garments, pain pumps and even laser procedures to accelerate healing of scars should be part of the price of surgery. be careful about low priced surgery as there may be ways to reduce fees by cutting corners that could compromise the safety of a patient, or potentially impact the result of surgery. You are trussing a surgeon with your health and well being and you are trusting this person to make a permanent change in your body. Take your time with your surgery and choose wisely. (Michael Law, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Abdominoplasty and Liposuction is safe and essential</h3><p>This is a very common combination. To achieve the optimal abdominal contour liposuction is essential while performing an Abdominoplasty. This combo is safe when performed in experience surgical hands.</p><p>Your physician should explain to you where any liposuction will be performed prior to surgery and the morning of surgery as they perform the preoperative markings. (Todd B. Koch, MD, Buffalo Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction and tummy tuck surgery</h3><p>Although I usually combine liposuction and tummy tuck because I believe the contouring is better I am conservative with where I liposuction.</p><p>I never liposuction the flap that is created during a tummy tuck. I will liposuction the flanks as this will not affect the blood supply to the flap.</p><p>I avoid liposuctioning the flap because this can injure the flap which will increase chance of skin loss and open wounds. (Sharon Theresa McLaughlin MD, Long Island City Plastic Surgeon</p><h3>Hip liposuction and tummy tuck surgery are safe, effective and essential</h3><p>Flank or hip Liposuction and a Tummy Tuck is a safe and effective procedure if done in healthy patients that are non-smokers and not obese.</p><p>I think it is almost essential to combine at least these two procedures in most patients to get the best results to avoid the excess lateral or outer bulge after doing a tummy tuck.</p><p>The hip or flank liposuction prevents this problem and helps to dramatically improve or narrow the waist/hip area after the tummy tuck. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tummy Tuck, Abdominoplasty, Liposuction</h3><p>The combination of surgeries such as tummy tuck surgery and liposuction can be done. The important considerations are your surgical risks. Patients that are overweight, smokers, diabetic or on the Birth Control Pill are at higher risk for blood clot and blood thinning agents should be considered following surgery. (Trevor M. Born, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction and tummy tuck surgery</h3><p>Although many surgeons may perform both in the same visit, the question is what is the risk of performing liposuction of the abdomen and doing a tummy tuck the same day?</p><p>Is there a chance of a fat embolus traveling which can be fatal. If this was the anatomic site you were contemplating having done, then ask your surgeon about the safety of doing both together. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction and tummy tuck can be combined</h3><p>In Florida if done in an office surgery setting only 1 liter of fat can be remove doing a Tummy Tuck. If done in a hospital setting or Ambulatory Surgery Center I have remove up to 3 liters of fat. The surgeon must determine the safety of the combination of Tummy Tuck with liposuction, if you are a good candidate, medical risks, good informed consent, risk/benefit ratios. (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction of the flanks is fine with a tummy tuck</h3><p>I will very often combine liposuction of the flanks with a tummy tuck. However, because the most dangerous risk of a tummy tuck is blood clot problems in your leg veins (DVT), I will never do lipo below the waist at the same time.</p><p>In order to prevent DVT, one of the vital measures is early and frequent ambulation so I would not want to add pain to your legs and lessen the chance of your walking. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Do not combine tummy tuck surgery with liposuction of the thighs.</h3><p>Liposuction and tummy tuck surgery are routinely done together. But to keep things safe, the questions are how much liposuction, and of what areas. So it’s hard to generalize. We usually do liposuction of the upper abdomen and of the love handles. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction and abdominoplasty surgery</h3><p>Of course they can be performed simultaneously. The real question is how safe and accurate is it to do at the same time. Safety involves many factors but the predominate one as it relates to abdominoplasty and liposuction is blood flow concerns and subsequent healing. Aggressive lipsuction of areas that are then moved or tightened with abdominoplasty can lead to skin necrosis. Planning has to been done with this in mind. Other issues are blood loss and length of surgery. Careful consultation with a board-certified plastic surgery is required and it is always safer to be more conservative. When in doubt, do it in two stages. (Robin T.W. Yuan, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>An abdominoplasty can be performed with some liposuction. I would not lipo the central area of the flap if I am performing a full tummy tuck, but certainly liposuction of the hips or thighs is ok. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction and tummy tuck surgery can usually be done at the same time as long as the two operations do not interfere with each other.</p><p>There are certain areas in which lipo should not be performed when a tummy tuck is done at the same time. Other than this they can be done together. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Abdominoplasty can also involve liposuction for a contoured waist – as long as it is safe!</h3><p>Abdominoplasty has the goals of removing excess skin and fat from the lower abdomen, tightening the abdominal wall contour, and bringing the rectus abdominis muscles back together in the midline.</p><p>Liposuction simply removes excess fat in areas where it is deposted in excess. Sometimes, these two procedures are combined for the most aesthetic result.</p><p>However, this must be done in the safest way possible, without creating additional risks. I usually perform the abdominoplasty portion first, and then evaluate whether there is any additional fat remaining that may be appropriate for liposuction.</p><p>Next, if considering liposuction to enhance the procedure, I will infiltrate the tumescent solution which constricts the blood vessels to the area and decreases the risk for bleeding and bruising with suctioning of fat.</p><p>If any of the abdominal skin appears to have a compromised circulation, then I will stop here and not perform liposuction, to avoid the risk of wound healing problems.</p><p>However, if the abdominal skin appears to be healthy and pink, without any circulatory compromise, I may also perform a careful and limited amount of liposuction, usually to the flanks and possibly upper abdomen and/or pubic area at that time.</p><p>In Plastic Surgery, healing is based on having a good circulation to the tissues. It is always wise to do the safest procedure and avoid complications, rather than power ahead and risk “doing too much” at one time! (Karen M. Horton, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tummy Tuck with Lipo</h3><p>There are 2 safety issues when considering combing an abdominoplasty with liposuction: DVT risk – deep venous thrombosis (blood clots in the veins) and pulmonary embolism (which can cause sudden death after surgery). This is a time dependent risk that is present with every operation performed (longer operations have more risk).</p><p>There are some studies that suggest combining a tummy tuck with lower extremity liposuction have a notably higher risk for DVT occurrence, so many surgeons will not offer this combination. Perfusion to the tummy tuck skin – liposuction requires vasoconstriction during surgery to avoid blood loss, and results in localized edema after surgery. Both of these interfere with blood flow, and could compromise the viability of the tummy tuck skin. Because of this, I would not perform liposuction of the abdomen, bra roll region, or upper back at the time of a tummy tuck. (Michael A. Bogdan, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Safety and combined Tummy Tuck and Lipo</h3><p>Many patients who are candidates for a tummy tuck also have localized areas of fat that they want addressed at the same time. Studies do show that it is safe if the surgery time isn’t too long and the patient is in good health and not overweight. There are limits to how much lipo can be done in a single session though (the wmost widely accepted number is 5 liters), and less when a tummy tuck is done too. (Richard Baxter, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Can Liposuction and Tummy Tuck be done at the same time?</h3><p>Liposuction and the length of the surgery required. It is important that the liposuction not compromise the blood vessels necessary for healing of the tummy tuck or dramatically increase your risk of a serious complication like a blood clot after surgery. The best way to get an answer that is accurate and responsible given your particular situation is to consult with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. Here is a bit of help on how to find one you like.
