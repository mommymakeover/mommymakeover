The results of a tummy tuck, especially in the flanks (“love handles”), can be enhanced with the use of liposuction.</p><p>I always combine the two to maximize my results. However, there are general restrictions as to the amount of fat that can be removed in conjunction with a tummy tuck.</p><p>These restrictions are state-dependent. Please consult with a board-certified plastic surgeon. (Moises Salama, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combining lipo and tummy tuck is safe</h3><p>Abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) can be performed at the same time with lipo of the flanks and hips with success. I consider the abdomen and the hips & flank areas as one aesthetic unit.</p><p>In order to recreate a narrow waist and accentuate the hip contour, I perform liposuction of the flanks and hips at the same as the tummy tuck procedure.</p><p>I think this would give the best aesthetic results and it is safe. You should consult a board certified plastic surgeon in your area for the best and safe result. (Mytien Goldberg, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Can Lipo and Tummy Tuck Be Done at the Same Time?</h3><p>Abdominoplasty and lipo are frequently done simultaneously to obtain an optimum result. The liposuction cannulas are usually used laterally on the love handles.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_367" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-4a7b238664083e65d5be4ddbc0d7436e">

</div><p>Caution that more central fat should be liposuctioned at another setting to avoid compromise of blood supply to the skin. (Thomas Guillot, MD, Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tummy tucks and liposuctioning flanks</h3><p>It is certainly possible to combine abdominoplasty with liposuctioning, but be aware that there is a clear limit as to how much fat should be removed with this combination.</p><p>Safety concerns suggest no more than 1000 to 1500cc. of fat should be suctioned with this combination. Surgery will always require good judgement on the part of surgeons to minimize the risks to patients. The relatively small amount of fat removed may not make a serious difference in the contour of patient, unless one limits this to the lateral hips and flanks along the edges of the tummy tuck. Larger areas for suctioning such as the back, lower hips and flanks, thighs should be done at a later time, in my opinion. Always discuss this with your Plastic Surgeon as you plan this surgery. (Francis (Frank) William Rieger, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tummy tuck and liposuction flanks combination is a winner!</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_368" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-aec967d40d356933126649b0e03750ff">

</div><p>It is safe to perform liposcution at the time of your tummy tuck. In fact, liposuction of the flanks and hips can enhance the results of a tummy tuck by giving a women a narrower waistline. (S. Sean Younai, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction & Tummy Tuck</h3><p>It is important to schedule a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon to discuss your specific medical condition and plastic surgery goals.</p><p>An extensive procedure like this may not be safe for patients with certain conditions, so be sure to discuss your complete medical history during a consultation.</p><p>Variables that would determine whether or not tummy tuck and liposuction can be performed at the same time include the amount of fat you want removed, the areas you want to improve with liposuction and the type of tummy tuck. Patients interested in a removing large amount of fat in multiple areas on top of a tummy tuck may be advised to have separate surgeries as a precaution. Additionally, some patients need a circumferential tummy tuck (excess tissue taken all the way around abdomen and back) while others only need a mini tummy tuck. Schedule a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon to determine which procedure is most appropriate for you. (David Whiteman, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combination Procedures</h3><p>Many tummy tucks are combined with liposuction of the hips and thighs. After pregnancy and breast feeding, there is usually some loose skin and possibly some excess fat in the abdomen.</p><p>Many women carry some extra fat in the hip and thigh area after pregnancy. In order to get the best result, liposuction is commonly performed in these areas when a tummy tuck is performed. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lipo and Tummy Tuck</h3><p>It is possible to have both lipo and a tummy tuck done at the same time. Liposuction is an excellent method of removing unwanted fat, while a tummy tuck is used to remove and tighten excess skin as well as tighten the underlying muscles.</p><p>Combining the two procedures can produce a dramatic improvement, resulting in a flat, sculpted belly.There are considerations about the amount of liposuctioning and the areas that it can be done in when combined with a tummy tuck.</p><p>This is largely due to the need to maintain adequate blood flow to allow healing after the surgery. As plastic surgeons have gained more experience with this combination, and done scientific research on it, many surgeons have become increasingly comfortable with doing both procedures at the same time.</p><p>This has lead to better results for our patients. If this is something that you are considering, a consultation with a plastic surgeon will determine if you are a candidate. (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tummy tuck and lipo in Los Angeles</h3><p>There are some areas on the body that can undergo liposuction at the same time as a tummy tuck. Other areas increase the risk of poor scarring. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction of the waist is commonly performed along with an abdominoplasty.</h3><p>Many plastic surgeons will perform liposuction of the waist (flanks and low back) along with an abdominoplasty in order to obtain an improved truncal appearance and contour.</p><p>Although I do not perform liposuction directly on the front abdominal fat, I will perform direct removal of the deep layers of fat from the front abdominal fat. (Sanjay Grover, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lipo and Tummy Tuck</h3><p>It is very common to perform liposuction of the waist/flanks or thighs at the time of a tummy tuck. please schedule a consult with a board certified ps to start learning about your options. (Sugene Kim, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tummy Tuck and Liposuction at the Same Time</h3><p>Most surgeons do perform some liposuction together with a tummy tuck. For example, I routinely perform liposuction in the “love-handles” (flanks) together with tummy tuck.</p><p>It is also possible to do liposuction in other areas of the body such as the inner or outer thighs at the same time as tummy tuck.</p><p>However, there are limitations to the amount that can be safely removed, which will depend on your size and weight as well as the number of areas that you would like liposuctioned.</p><p>It is the responsibility of your surgeon to help guide the limitations in this regard so that you can get the most results within the limits of what can be performed safely. (Cory Goldberg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combination of liposuction and tummy tuck</h3><p>Those can be combined with a caveat. I would not recommend performing liposuction in the central upper and lower portions of the abdomen. The main reason is blood supply. Your skin is essentially surviving on a blood supply that comes from the sides of your body towards the center.</p><p>Liposuction can be done in the lower portion of your flanks and hips. This will certainly improve the contour overall. (Raj S. Ambay, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>They can be combined</h3><p>Liposuction and tummy tuck can be combined in the same surgery. It is important to talk to your doctor about your medical history and listen to their advice.</p><p>When you combine surgeries it will increase the amount of time you will be under general anesthesia.</p><p>You want to make sure it is safe to be under for extended periods of time.</p><p>Make sure to talk to your surgeon about what you can expect and weigh your options. (Amy K. Alderman, MD, FACS, MPH, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tummy tuck and liposuction at the same time: Lipoabdominoplasty</h3><p>An abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) and liposuction can be done at the same time. It is really, the modern approach to body contouring and provides optimal results.</p><p>It has been termed a lipoabdominoplasty, and should be performed by an experienced plastic surgeon because it can be technically more challenging than a simple tummy tuck.</p><p>The addition of liposuction can help with outer and upper inner abdominal contouring, which in the past (and even now) has been criticized.</p><p>I perform it routinely on almost every abdominoplasty. Make sure you consult with a board certified plastic surgeon. (Andrew P. Trussler, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction and Tummy Tuck</h3><p>In most cases, liposuction of the flanks can safely be done at the same time as abdominoplasty. Occasionally, liposuction can also be performed to other parts of the body. It really depends on your anatomy and the extent of surgery that is required for your abdominoplasty. (David Shafer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction and tummy tuck</h3><p>Adding liposuction of the hips and upper back to an abdominoplasty, or tummy tuck, is a great way to define the waist.</p><p>Although it is extra operative time, this added risks are minimal and it gives my patients that “hour glass” appearance they are looking for. (Neil J. Zemmel, MD, FACS, Midlothian Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lipo and tummy tuck at the same time.</h3><p>It is very common to do liposuction at the time of a tummy tuck. At a minimum, I use liposuction to contour the waist and upper hips at the time of tummy tuck.</p><p>Often, we add contouring of the back and bra rolls and/or the thighs as well. The amount that can be done safely depends on the surgery time and the volume of liposuction. Talk with your plastic surgeon about your options. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction and tummy tuck at same time</h3><p>Combining procedures is very dependent on the individual patient. How healthy are you, and how long will it take to complete the operations. Often we will perform a tummy tuck, and then liposuction on flanks, back or legs. We usually do not do liposuction the tummy and tummy tuck at the same time.</p><p>Make sure that you are fit enough for surgery. Consult a board certified plastic surgeon and together determine what is best for you. (Jeffrey Roth, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction combined with a tummy-tuck</h3><p>Liposuction of the abdomen and waist can safely be combined with a mini or full tummy-tuck. Plastic surgeons are uniquely qualified to combine these two techniques, as it takes experience to safely perform liposuction and tightening of skin and muscle.</p><p>Frequently, I will recommend liposuction of the flanks and bra-strap area to provide a slimmer waist. Liposuction of the waist and bra-strap area can be combined with tummy-tuck to lower the waist-line to produce a balance appearance. (Andrew T. Lyos, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction performed at same time as tummy tuck</h3><p>A tummy tuck procedure, or abdominoplasty, may be combined with a number of other procedures, including liposuction. Liposuction is often performed on the flanks and hips to help achieve a better contour. (Olivia Hutchinson, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Consider surgery time</h3><p>Liposuction can be performed at the same time as a tummy tuck. Since you will already be under general anesthesia there are some things to consider. The over surgical time is important when performing two procedures at once.</p><p>You do not want to under general anesthesia for more time than is healthy for you. Talk to your surgeon about how much time under general anesthesia is necessary for you to receive a tummy tuck and some liposuction. This will depend on how much liposuction you will need and how invasive your abdominoplasty will be. (Joseph G. Bauer, MD, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lipo and Tummy tuck</h3><p>Lipo and tummy tuck can be performed at the same time as long as it limited to certain area.</p><p>Most plastic surgeons will limit lipo to the flanks and avoid the central abdomen. Lipo is usually performed with tummy tuck.</p><p>It takes experience to do it correctly to avoid problems. Plastic surgeons are always concerned about blood supply.</p><p>Equally important is the person doing the liposuction. Make sure that he/she is a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgeon. Do your homework before the consultation (Stanley Okoro, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lipo at same time as tummy tuck</h3><p>Lipo can be performed at the same time as a tummy tuck provided it is limited to certain areas. This means it is safe to do liposuction of the flanks or sides at the same time but not the mid or upper abdominal area.</p><p>The reason for this is that the blood supply to the abdominal skin/tissue can be jeopardized and compromised which can lead to serious wound healing complications and infection.</p><p>If your upper abdomen is of particular concern to you, then it is best to have lipo of that area done at a separate stage, about one year after (or before) the tummy tuck.</p><p>Be sure your plastic surgeon explains carefully to you where exactly he/she plans to perform liposuction at the time of your tummy tuck. (William Bruno, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lipo and tummy tuck definately work the best</h3><p>I perform many tummy tuck operations and always liposuction the flanks (hips) at the same time as the tummy tuck.</p><p>It helps me to contour the abdomen and looks much better as it heals. I always combo it as my patients love having a slimmer waistine after the tummy tuck. (Andrew T. Cohen, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lipo and Tummy Tuck Combination</h3><p>Most surgeons would feel performing lipo on the abdomen at the time of a tummy tuck would increase the risks of serious complications so they are seldom done together. The two procedures done at the same time can dramatically impact the blood supply to the skin of the abdomen and possibly cause skin death.</p><p>Lipo on other areas of the body does not compromise the abdominal wall blood supply and can be done safely at the time of tummy tuck without any real impact on recovery from the tummy tuck. (John K. Long, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Abdominoplasty with lipo ?</h3><p>It is fairly common to do lipo of the upper abdomen and hips at the same time as an abdominoplasty.</p><p>How ever lipo of the thighs should be done separately do to excess swelling and the blood supply may be compromised. (William Aiello, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tummy tuck and lipo can be done together</h3><p>I usually do liposuction at the time of a tummy tuck. Liposuction allows reduction of the fat under the remaining tummy skin, thinning and smoothing of the fat along the edges of the tummy, and removal of unwanted fat in other areas. This allows us to make everything more proportional. (Randy J. Buckspan, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lipo and tummy tuck can be done at the same time</h3><p>Lipo is commonly done at the same time as a tummy tuck. In our practice, all tummy tucks have liposuction included. This is because liposuction is a wonderful way for us to reach areas that we otherwise would not be able to access the traditional tummy tuck.</p><p>Liposuction flanks can allow us to redefine the shape of the abdomen and re-create curves in a way that a traditional tummy tuck cannot.</p><p>Be sure to discuss your concerns with and experienced and board-certified plastic surgeon so that they may carefully evaluate you and help you decide what combination will best meet your aesthetic goals (Pat Pazmino, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
