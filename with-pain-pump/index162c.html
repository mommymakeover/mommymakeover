As far as the menstrual cycle at time of surgery goes, this is usually no big deal.</p><p>Some will say that there may be just a little more bruising. We really have not seen this. Menstruation starting right before surgery happens all the time.</p><p>This is not a reason in of itself to postpone surgery. (Jeffrey J. Roth, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Pain is a very subjective experience and is influenced by many things – including your expectations.</p><p>Regarding your menstrual cycle, this typically does not have a significant impact on your surgery, recovery, or outcome, aside from having to deal with your normal menstrual symptoms in addition to your surgical recovery. (Bryan Correa, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I believe c-section pain and tummy tuck recovery are comparable. Patients who have had a c-section seem better able to handle discomfort than those who have not.</p><p>We are not concerned about menstruation interfering with the scheduled surgery.  (Donald Nunn, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>With a normal menstrual cycle and no known anemia, your Mommy Makeover surgery will not be affected by your period. (Douglas J. Raskin, MD, Colorado Springs Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Menstruation has no bearing on your surgery (or we would be rescheduling surgeries right and left.) With regards to pain, the cesarean is associated with more postoperative pain, mainly due to muscle tearing.</p><p>Nevertheless, your experience as a whole will be affected by how your pain is managed. Proper pain control in the first post-op days is very important to me.</p><p>I give my patients pain pills to take home as part of the procedure, and always pay attention to how they are doing.</p><p></p>

</div>It is uncommon for my patients to have unmanageable pain after the procedure you are having. (Barbara Persons, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)
<p>It is fine to have plastic surgery during your menstrual period. One thing to be aware of, however, is that many common medications for menstrual cramps (Advil, Motrin, ibuprofen, and the like) can increase bleeding tendencies, and most plastic surgeons will ask you to refrain from using those medicines prior to surgery.</p><p>For my patients with menstrual cramps, headaches, and other body aches in the days leading up to surgery, I recommend Tylenol if needed for pain. (Lara Devgan, MD, MPH, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Typically a tummy tuck hurts much less than a C-section. It is not uncommon for patients to be menstruating at the time of surgery. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>It is difficult to generalize about the pain experienced after a mommy makeover versus a c-section, because each person’s response to surgery is different.
<p>As for surgery while menstruating, this is not a contraindication for most plastic surgery procedures. (William Andrade, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Is Mommy Makeover More Painful than C-Section?</h3><p>Most of my tummy tuck and breast augmentation patients who had C-sections say the Mommy Makeover pain isn’t as bad. Positioning makes a big difference in controlling pain. I tell my tummy tuck/breast aug patients to sleep slightly propped up on a wedge of pillows or in a recliner.</p><p>Ice packs along the sides of the breasts and over the muscles help as well. I agree with your surgeon’s office that your period shouldn’t pose a problem. (It’s just inconvenient for you!) (Heather J. Furnas, MD, Santa Rosa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>The pain from a tummy tuck depends on how tight the muscle are made at the time of surgery. I think the pain is less than a c-section. Also, menstruating at the time of surgery does not present a problem at all. (Ronald J. Edelson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)
<p>The tummy tuck has been greatly reduced with the use of Exparel. It can cause decreased sensation for up to three days. I recommend it and all my tummy tuck patients get it. They need far less Percocet. (Frank J. Ferraro, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Having surgery while menstruating is normally not a problem. Avoid using any pain relievers that contain aspirin and if possible avoid any pain medications other than acetaminophen (Tylenol) within 12 hours of surgery. The recovery from a tummy tuck is similar to that of a C-section. It may be slightly more uncomfortable but there are options available (such as a pain pump) which can dramatically decrease the amount of pain that you have. Discuss these options with your surgeon. For the best results seek the consultation of a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. </p><p></p>

</div>They have a website listing all the certified plastic surgeons. Members of the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery will all be board certified in plastic surgery and have demonstrated an interest and competence in cosmetic plastic surgery as well. (Alexander G. Nein, MD, MS, FACS, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Many patients experience some anxiety when they are menstruating and about to have surgery.  I do not consider this a concern.  The surgery is safe and you will heal just as well. (David Stoker, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no need to be concerned about menstruating the day of surgery. Many women have tummy tucks following c-section surgery and they recover very well. Be sure to follow your doctors orders closely. (Michael Law, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Ok so as far as Menstruating is concerned, you should be fine. That is assuming you are not anemic from a history of heavy bleeding. </p><p></p>

</div>If you are having surgery I am sure your doctor has checked your labs and cleared you. As for C-sec vs TT pain. They are close and comparable in nature. Some say that a C-sec is more painful as the muscles are stretched but I think for the sake of comparison you are safe to assume they’re the same (Rady Rahban, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)
<p>It is ok to have surgery during your menstrual cycle – in fact, the anxiety that upcoming surgery involuntarily causes may bring your period on. The only potential issue is breast surgery and if there is a significant change perceived with the menstrual cycle in the breasts – this is more of a theoretical concern than a real problem. The surgical pain will not be way worse on your cycle. We see this alot. Please remember to not place a tampon before surgery. If it’s forgotten, and it might be, could cause Toxic Shock Syndrome if in place too long. Take care! (Michele A. Shermak, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>There is no reason you can’t have surgery based on your menstrual cycle. You should be prepared for some downtime with respect to the tummy tuck portion. Whether it is worse than a C-section. It will depend. With a C-section you will be cutting deeper through the abdominal wall and uterus. With a tummy tuck, the dissection is more extensive and superficial. Either surgery takes time to recover. I would consider using a pain pump to help manage post-op pain. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Most patients describe the tummy tuck as being quite similar to a c section as far as post operative pain. There is no concern about menstruating on the day of surgery. This is quite common with women having cosmetic surgery and does not affect the surgery or the outcome. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You will find any opinion that you want concerning patients post op pain thresholds. In fact, the recovery from C sections and Mommy Makeovers cannot really be compared but in general, it will give an indication of how a patient recovers during the first days/weeks.</p><p>In relation to you having your period, no real biggie. There will be minor changes in the breasts as they settle but nothing that you will notice as being different from having the procedure without your period. The tummy tuck will not have any unpredictable issues because of the time of the month. Many of the Mommy Makeovers that I do have tampons in place as the procedure is done. You will not need to “time” the procedure. It is a wonderful change and look forward to a lifelong enjoyment of the new curves.<br>

</div>Finally, discuss with your doctor the concerns of post op issues such as pain and how that will be handled. With my patients, if they need pain medicines (within reason), then they get whatever is needed in the first weeks. I am not an aspirin doctor and “rough it out”. They make pain meds for pain and that is why if you need that medication, you get it. You will not become an addict and many patients feel that they need to suck it up because they did this procedure. This is not the attitude that a patient should take and the experience after the procedure should be one of you and your doctor working together during each step of the process. (Steven M. Lynch, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)
<p>It is definitely okay to have a surgery while menstruating. Also, to answer your pain question, mommy makeover is not typically as painful as a c-section from what my patients tell me. I make every effort to control the pain after the surgery with long acting carefully places local anesthetic.  (Jason Mussman, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>In my experience, most of my patients tell me that the pain after a tummy tuck is quite comparable to what they eperienced after their C-section. As far as your menstrual cycle, do not be concerned. Unless you have extremely heavy periods or are anemic to begin with, you will be fine. Most plastic surgery procedures involve very little blood loss. (Niki Christopoulos, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Every person experiences pain and recovers differently. That said, in my experience patients usually tell me that their c section was more painful than their mommy makeover. Menstruation is no problem. Best wishes. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You have had your surgery by now and hope you are pleased. There is no reason to alter surgical plans if you are menstruating. You may have a bit more bruising, but it should not affect the procedure or your healing. </p><p></p>

</div>It is important to not take NSAIDS or aspirin if you are suffering from cramps. Always ask your surgeon prior to your surgery if you have any questions or to express your concerns about the procedure, preparation or recovery. (Marialyn Sardo, MD, La Jolla Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Not having plastic surgery when you’re on your cycle is one of those persistent myths surrounding menstruation. There’s no reason you can’t follow through on your procedures as scheduled without any increased risk of complications. Just be sure to let your surgeon and staff know ahead of time. (Glenn M. Davis, MD, FACS, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As long as your monthly cycle is not overly heavy and you don’t use an abundance of pain relievers (NSAIDs like advil), there should be no interference with surgery. Mommy Makeover surgeries typically involve very little blood loss. </p><p>If your cycle is typically heavy, you may have a small degree of anemia. Again, assuming you are healthy, this should not pose additional risks for your surgery.</p><p>As far as NSAIDs usage goes, this can thin the blood somewhat,but this is seen mainly with those that can’t seem to function without it during this time of the month. This will typically lead to a slightly increased amount of bruising. Still, this should not be prohibitive for the surgery. I would advise discussing this with your surgeon, just like you would with any other medication usage. (Michael Burgdorf, MD, MPH, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Menstrual Cycle around surgery time</i><br>
I have been told by many patients the pain is comparable to a c-section though since you don’t have the distraction and excitement of a new baby, the pain is primarily directed to the abdomen so it is often said to be more painful than a c-section.</p><p>It is safe to proceed with plastic surgery during your menstrual cycle. It is also not uncommon for surgery to delay or trigger a menstrual cycle. The pain medication should manage your pain and discomfort regardless of a menstrual cycle. (Alan N. Larsen, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
